[]{#anchor}About the Guide
==========================

Early development, sidebars and clarifications in teal, FIXME notes in
yellow. I might also set colors for examples and playtester questions.

Some day, in the distant future, I want to post this on github.io as a
free, copyleft RPG---but I want to get this a lot more polished first.

Right now, I'm still play-testing and revising it---basically it's in
Alpha stages of development. As such, it's a bullet list, with
crossed-out sections and developer notes.

Editing Notes:

-   I need to go through and use the term Tag consistently. And then
    also re-work most entries to use Tags.
-   I'm trying to use "the character" or "a character" consistently, to
    emphasize that players and NPCs use the same rules. I need to go
    back and edit this to be the case.
-   I'm trying to use "they" in cases where gender is unknown or
    unspecified. I *really hate* the "pick an arbitrary gender" writing
    style that many d20 systems use.
-   I'd like to use lower-case for race names ("orc" and "elf" instead
    of "Orc" and "Elf." I was using caps for a long while tho, so much
    editing will be required.)
-   At least for now, I've decided on just calling it *magic*. I wanted
    to use something a little fancier, like *essence*, but I couldn't
    come up with something I wanted to commit to. I'm using the terms
    *mage* and *spell,* *psion* and *sleight*, and *priest* and *boon*.
    I may revisit this.

    -   I've specifically avoided using "arcane" as a description,
        because it annoys me that a generation of grognards are growing
        up who think that that word means "knowledge magic" and don't
        realize that it actually just means "difficult secret."

Changes since last time:

-   Skills

    -   Collapsed Academics and Interest into Knowledge.
    -   Added more tags to many skills.
    -   Added descriptive text, use clarifications and example fields to
        several skills.
    -   Removed Investigate (added a hint to use Profession: Detective
        in the Corner Cases block).

-   Classes / Traits / Powers

    -   Added corpse-buddy classes
    -   Added armor bonuses to Master and Transcend, which where
        otherwise a little lackluster.
    -   Renamed the Cleric and Wizard classes to Priest and Mage,
        respectively.

-   Guns as an optional rule

    -   I reduced the damage that slugs and shot do, but scour still
        does 2d10/turn to anyone coated. Scour on, rat queen.

-   Moved the maneuver system to an alternate rule, with a blue-block in
    the combat rules pointing to it. (So it's a *highly recommended*
    optional rule.)
-   Added a section on using magical rituals to create powerful, one-off
    magical effects.

    -   It has short guidelines for powerful spells for mages, powerful
        trances for psions and summoning powerful spirits for priests.

-   Items

    -   copied over throwing knives, slow-fall cape
    -   added short staff

-   Added "Unusual Movement" as a movement mode.

    -   This change is borrowed from EP2, and is used to "canonize" that
        you can do "all kinds of crazy tricks" when you move.
    -   \...and then I decided to rename it "stunt" because I think that
        might be more evocative of how it's actually supposed to be
        used.

-   Re-wrote the Orc's background, copied the orcs over. (Let me know if
    this works for you, Sinestro.)
-   Hastily dashed off more info on Wood Elves for King K. (Sorry I kind
    of half-assed it, I really needed to get this version out. Let me
    know if this works for you, King K, and any improvements you care to
    make would be appreciated.)
-   Reworded the advancing block to be a little clearer.
-   Added Reputations as alternate rules (King K suggested this, and I
    thought it was a good idea).
-   Added (very short!) optional rules for buying back negative traits.
-   Moved the Skill List section to be before the Character Creation
    Rules section.

To-Do:

-   Lots more player options!

    -   I did the classes and powers and backgrounds that where
        interesting to me, but I really need to do samples for others
        too.

-   Change *Maneuvers* to maybe *Feats* as the name for martial powers.
-   Use the term "tag" throghout, and convert many existing systems to
    use tags.
-   Convert "walk" and "run" movement to "base" and "full",
    respectively.

Feedback Questions

-   I think the skill list is near its final state, but any further
    feedback is appreciated.
-   Races, especially race balance, and good features for some of the
    races! Some of the races are pretty boring, compared to drakes and
    kobolds!
-   Likewise, powers and power balance! We need better coverage in
    traits, classes, items and powers.
-   The two-weapon fighting rules are complex, and haven't been
    exercised much. Feedback would be appreciated. If anyone can come up
    with a way to make them simpler without making them worse, that'd be
    good!
-   Likewise, the touch- and indicate-only rules are a snarl, and any
    feedback or suggestions for improvement would be appreciated.
-   Changes to how sustains work. You used to loose a quick action for
    having any active sustains, but that made the turn cycle too
    annoying; now you just take a -10 penalty for each sustain beyond
    the first. Any thoughts on which way is better, or if there's a
    better third option?
-   Feedback on the new Using Magic block.

    -   Do you have a good enough feel for the kind of things you can
        do?
    -   Is it a GM's nightmare (Sauce)?

-   Feedback on making combat maneuvers a "recommended optional rule"?

Contributors:

-   Sauce: a list of powers!
-   SeaVea: fort design, feedback on armor and weapons.
-   King K: the Gnomes, Drugs, help with rep networks.
-   Sinestro: stealth powers, giving the barter system a good exercise.
    Reworking the Orcs.
-   Misandry: helping to fill out the Shamblers.
-   Runic: clever uses for fireballs. Lobsters!

The setting is an attempt to bring a little bit of Roddenberry-esque
multi-cultural optimism to fantasy role-playing; owing to its Eclipse
Phase heritage, it has also proved to support cosmic horror fairly well.

I also want it to feel like the plausible history and current state of a
complete other world. This means that it needs to be historically
plausible, at least by comparison to (for example) "Points of Light,"
the default Pathfinder setting, which includes everything from the
perpetual French revolution to the Russian steppes to strange
techno-magic warring desert robots. At the same time, I don't want to
line up with any existing culture or region too closely; this isn't
re-branded Earth, it's a whole other world, evolving and developing
under entirely different circumstances.

Finally, instead of looking back, I want to look forward: it's not the
story of a culture bravely picking up the pieces of a long-lost empire,
rather it's the story of a prosperous people on the cusp of
renaissance---or, as Runic pointed out, a "Naissance," since they're the
first major culture on their world---whose major opponents are other
unstable states, common corruption, and cosmic forces beyond mortal
ken---at least for now.

[]{#anchor-1}Background
=======================

[]{#anchor-2}The Green Country
------------------------------

The continent

-   Takes place on large northern-hemisphere continent (the Emerald
    Plain).

    -   Named for how heavily forested it is.
    -   "Forrest\'s Spine" range in middle, two long plains sloping to
        sea on either side
    -   alt: World's Spine or Worldspine. Need a better name than
        Forrest Spine.

-   Large island chain off to the West (The Haven Isles), of which
    Islandholm is the largest (and Islandholm is very large).

    -   Change from last revision: Haven Isles are a chain, of which
        Islandholme is the largest. Editing is required.

-   Third continent approaching from the South. No land bridge yet,
    large gulf (about 900km); only recently able to cross it.

    -   The Raptor's Plane
    -   Possible geography: heavy jungle in the West and center, desert
        in the East.
    -   might pick a different name referencing their feathers and
        plumage.
    -   The average North-South distance of the Mediterranean sea is
        800km, I used that as a guide. Although I might prefer it to be
        bigger.

-   (I wanted to avoid being Fantasy America or Fantasy Europe right
    from the beginning, so I tried to get geography that didn't line up
    with either. I did an imperfect job.)

[]{#anchor-3}History
--------------------

Distant History

-   Humans first to build cities, develop settled agriculture
-   Human city-states rise up on shores of rivers, flowing east from
    World's Spine to sea
-   Spread quickly, crossing World's Spine. Penetrate territories of
    other pre-settled races and peoples
-   Humans found an Empire

    -   empire run from and for the three major city-states (all in the
        Eastern-most region of the continent, on rivers flowing from the
        World's Spine to the sea)
    -   "Roman Style": the rest of the Empire is conquered territory,
        administered for the benefit of citizens of the Three Cities.

-   Spreads too far:

    -   distant colonies become as large and prosperous as the Three
        Cities, but too far away to control
    -   Empire sends small populations of its citizens to rule distant
        territories; exports knowledge, culture and language

-   Dragon Karrach leads rebellion. Claims foothills on Eastern side of
    world-spine, cuts off most of the Empire\'s territory from Three
    Cities (\~150 years before first Charter)
-   Former Imperial territory continues to grow, but suffers power
    vacuum.
-   Dawn of the Commonwealth: Gnollish refugees, fleeing a purge in
    their own tribe, seek shelter in a human village, and are granted
    refuge and nearby Manor.

Commonwealth History

-   The charter that granted Gnolls a manor becomes an important
    document governing trade
-   Society benefits from strength of Gnolls
-   Bolstered by Gnolls, patrols secure countryside; trade flourishes,
    more manors founded.

    -   "first charter" is used to administer relations between manors
        and city
    -   it works but is unwieldy -- it was never intended to build the
        government for a nation.

-   Eastern Empire collapses, an event nobody else cares about
-   75 years later, New Charter replaces Old Charter: formally builds
    Charter Council.

    -   New Charter is actually designed as a governing document
    -   Any manor that signs the Charter is a member of the Commonwealth
    -   "league of city-states" type arrangement: each Manor and City is
        still a "law unto itself"
    -   The year the New Charter is signed is Charter Year 0 (CY 0)
    -   Commonwealth Council cannot make law: all they do is tax trade,
        and use money to fund Army and maintain Roads
    -   over next \~700 years, powers and missions expand, but are
        constrained by terms of charter. For example, some public
        schools opened, but run under road-building power, officially
        for the purpose of training engineers to build roads, bridges
        and dams.

-   Expand and flourish: cross World's Spine mountains

    -   other races (mostly) peacefully integrated: the manorial system
        is flexible, they're simple granted manors.
    -   Some Tribal Races refuse to integrate: the Commonwealth simply
        flows around their territories.
    -   This does leave large swathes of unclaimed territories in the
        middle of the continent (the "Tribal Lands", where tribal
        cultures still exist)

-   Feudalism takes root in territories of the Old Empire, Kingdoms
    built

    -   This will give rise to the Kingdoms of Men, a messy web of small
        Kingdoms.

-   First manor on the Western side of the World Spine signs charter in
    CY 91.
-   Dwarves encountered in the North in CY 103.
-   In CY 325, the Western coast is reached; in CY 350, the Haven Isles
    are reached, and Islandholm is settled.
-   CY 350, Karrach surrenders power of nobility, Dragonshire governed
    by "house of commons"
-   In CY 447, Shaded Sea People attack Islandholme and occupy it --
    briefly. Commonwealth counter-attack is devastating, liberating
    island twenty days later and shattering the forces of the houses
    that mounted it.

    -   Surviving Shade Elves are imprisoned in short term, slowly
        integrated into Commonwealth society. Ash elves are their
        descendants

-   CY 600, Kobolds flee genocide in eastern portion of Human Kingdoms;
    peacefully incorporated into Commonwealth

    -   Many settle in World's Spine mountains, many more continue to
        the Haven Isles.

-   CY 750, Commonwealth Compact replaces Commonwealth Charter

    -   The Commonwealth no works like a league of nations.
    -   Commonwealth territory split into Provinces and City-States:

        -   each province organizes itself
        -   city-states are independent of provinces, have their own
            top-level status.

    -   The Commonwealth Council still can't make law, but it has
        broader funding powers -- no longer just armies and civil
        engineers, can now undertake civil projects (like schools)
        directly
    -   Dragonshire formally incorporated as a Province (it was an
        independent allied nation)
    -   Clay Men formally incorporated (where formerly and allied
        people)
    -   Commonwealth Compact has an "enumeration of freedoms" that each
        Province (and each Manor) must provide.

[]{#anchor-4}Commonwealth Today
-------------------------------

-   Present Year: CY 830
-   Commonwealth has 4 Provinces (not counting the Tribal Lands)

    -   Heartland: original territory. The World-Spine, some territory
        East, and a large chunk West. Still a network of manors
        internally
    -   The Haven Isles: island chain off the Western coast, featuring
        one large sub-continent island (Islandholm), and several smaller
        islands. A federalized state in the modern sense.
    -   Northland: northern territories occupied by Dwarves, consists
        largely of the Dwarven holds that chose to join the Commonwealth
        (not all did).
    -   Tribal Territories: large swaths of central land-mass left
        un-governed

        -   complex relationship
        -   Not a province, more an Unorganized Territory
        -   Some tribes are Commonwealth members or allies, and some are
            not.

    -   Dragonshire: Territory in the South-East, between Heartland and
        the Kingdoms of Men. Essentially a constitutional monarchy, with
        a parliamentary republican government. Where the dragons are
        from.

-   There are three major city-states

    -   Twin Cities, old (above-ground) trade-city and new Kobold
        underground metropolis, built one-above-the-other in World Spine
        Mountains.
    -   Port City situated on Southern coast of Emerald Plain
    -   Royal City in Dragonshire?

-   The Commonwealth is stable and prosperous

    -   internal trade flourishes, mediated by the river-boats, by
        halfling and human trade caravans, and by sailing along the
        coast.
    -   The Commonwealth Council collects taxes, negotiates with
        external nations, and runs the Council organizations (like the
        Military and the Engineers).

        -   The Council can amend the Compact, although it's hard.
        -   The Council also manages inter-province disputes.
        -   Note that the Council doesn't make law, each province does
            that for themselves.

    -   The Commonwealth is internally stable.

        -   The military keeps the peace.
        -   People identify as Commonwealth citizens; they view this as
            important as racial or provincial identities.

    -   well-funded professional military (internal police, army, navy)

        -   provides a high level of security, and thus enables trade

    -   beginnings of public school system, libraries and museums
    -   well-maintained roads, prosperous internal trade

-   major concern is their neighbors

    -   sustained, bitter cold war with Shade Elf/Plague Rat alliance
    -   unstable states to the North East (Kingdom of Man) and
        South-East (Goblinoid Kingdoms)

-   Some internal corruption still exists

    -   notably in cities, and notably in the Heartland Province

-   Also, the whims of the spirits are a constant source of trouble

    -   I'll admit, originally I wasn't planning on focusing on this,
        but I think it's both more interesting and more flexible than
        the other themes I was going to focus on.

-   As can *other forces* (Fantasy-era Call of Cthulhu)

[]{#anchor-5}Commonwealth Technology
------------------------------------

-   I'm bad at history, but shooting for something-like Europe in
    1200-1400.

    -   I want them to have an impressive cultures, so I might bump that
        target year forward a little.

-   "Dark Ages" innovations occurred in Commonwealth around CY 300-500:

    -   heavy plow, three-field rotation, yoking horses for agriculture

-   (and, of course, they can make steel, ink, paper, brick, masonry,
    \...)
-   Have invented black powder, is used in cannons

    -   man-portable guns don't generally exist, but
    -   GM's could introduce blunderbusses or smooth-bore muzzle-loaders
        without too much disruption

-   Commonly harness natural energy

    -   windmills and water-wheels used to grind grain, pump water

-   Use of steam in heated baths, although not yet as an energy source
    (i.e. steam power)
-   Printing press invented 75 years ago (CY 755), society still
    adjusting from sudden surge in literature

[]{#anchor-6}Commonwealth Life, Society and Economy
---------------------------------------------------

-   90% of people are farmers, living in villages of a few hundred
    people.

    -   Most of the other people in these villages are also farmers --
        that is, not artisans, bureaucrats, traders, soldiers or
        priests.
    -   Though the income of these people is marginal, they are not
        serfs---they are not owned by local nobles, at least not in the
        Commonwealth at least.
    -   Many of these people know very little of the outside world, and
        will never be more than half a day's walk from the place they
        were born.
    -   Usefully for these people, the Commonwealth funds traveling
        teachers and medics. While they don't provide anything like a
        modern education system, they do at least guarantee that most
        citizens are literate and numerate, and that they have a sketch
        idea of their own history.
    -   Village farmers usually produce food for their own subsistence,
        and to feed the nearby manor to which they are associated.
    -   Typically populated by a few hundred people, usually of the same
        race (owing mainly to the need to have potential mates). Most
        villages are populated by either humans or gnolls.

-   Manors are large settlements; they are scattered throughout the
    countryside.

    -   Manors are, classically, overseen by a lord or central
        organization; though the Commonwealth has abolished formal
        serfdom, the organizations and lordly manors that founded manors
        often remain powerful and influential within their sphere.
    -   Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be "owned" by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
    -   Manors often host local administrators and priests.
    -   Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
    -   Manors often host traders.
    -   Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
    -   Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor's food production.
    -   Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

-   Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.

    -   Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
    -   Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes---rivers or major overland routes.
    -   Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars---and the lower-class helpers they employ.
    -   Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
    -   Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
    -   Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

-   Major Cities

    -   Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are *major
        cities*.
    -   Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand---sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
    -   Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

-   The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.

    -   Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
    -   Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
    -   Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
    -   The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
    -   Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
    -   Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
    -   Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth's
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

-   Trading Caravans

    -   A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
    -   Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        *dimorphic*: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
    -   Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

-   Underground Societies

    -   Several commonwealth races---notably Kobolds and Ash
        Elves---prefer to live underground.
    -   Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
    -   Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
    -   They also often support large populations of artisans.
    -   They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

-   I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.

[]{#anchor-7}Commonwealth Governance
------------------------------------

-   Move/expand above information here.
-   One feature of New Charter is that the Commonwealth can collect
    taxes from its provinces, which the Commonwealth Council can use to
    fund whatever operations they elect to (as opposed to specifically
    funding the patrols and roads under the Compact).

    -   This has lead to several new Commonwealth Council organizations.

-   One major such organization is the military.

    -   The Commonwealth has the known world's preeminent military.
    -   Their prosperity allows them to fund a permanent, professional
        military.
    -   This military actively patrols their interior and guards their
        frontiers.
    -   The security provided by their armed forces allows trade to
        flourish, and the might of their military substantially prevents
        attack by competing societies.
    -   Gnolls are a major race in the Commonwealth military, where
        their physical strength and endurance provide a formidable
        advantage over primarily Human, Shade Elf or Goblinoid armies.
    -   Kobolds have also found a place within the Commonwealth's
        armies, where their speed, tough hides and small size can make
        them useful infiltrators, raiders, scouts and spies.

-   Hmm. This section might be redundant to information in the
    Commonwealth Today and Organizations sections; I might also not want
    to go on at length about this. Possibly rework.

[]{#anchor-8}Commonwealth Magic
-------------------------------

Though the spirits are often inscrutable and the potential applications
for magic are vast, it is nevertheless true that the sages and scholars
of the Commonwealth have amassed a vast amount of useful knowledge of
magic, and that much of this knowledge has been deployed to the benefit
of the Commonwealth. It is studied in their universities, deployed in
their military, and sold in their cities by clerics and hedge-wizards.
While powerful magic items (e.g. magical weapons and armor) are rare,
simple magical tools and potions are common (see *Items* for a few
examples, by no means complete!).

Of special note is the recently-developed Kairne Network. Each Kairne is
an unassuming stack of standing-stones, surrounded by an open space and
paced out by smaller Kairnes arranged in a circle. These unassuming
ritual-sights allow magic-users who know how to use them to rapidly
transport themselves from any one Kairne to any other---allowing them to
cover great distances in the blink of an eye. Presently, only a dozen
Kairnes have been constructed, and the Kairne networks remain difficult
to use---in particular, few mages can carry much with them.

[]{#anchor-9}Other Factions
---------------------------

-   Kingdoms of Man: unstable feudal society to the East, where the
    Empire used to be.

    -   An unstable society, a lot of small human kingdoms tied together
        by a web of noble alliances.
    -   Rife with political intrigue as noble lines and power blocks vie
        for control, plenty of opportunity for adventures!
    -   Roughly divided between the Western portion, which is relatively
        more open and friendly with the Commonwealth, and the Eastern
        part, who are racist, humans-first asshole who would love to do
        as much damage to the Commonwealth as they can.
    -   Militarily overmatched by the Commonwealth, and so they've been
        at an uneasy peace for more than 150 years.

-   Shaded Sea People

    -   Alliance of Ratfolk and Shade Elves.
    -   Shade elves originate in the Southwestern corner of the Emerald
        Plane, where they were a fearsome mounted raiding people.
    -   Ratfolk originate in an island chain 300km off the coast, where
        they where skilled sailors.
    -   Complex history of raiding and violence.
    -   Both Shade Elves and then Ratfolk where forced to pay tribute by
        a third, rarely-encountered people, the Leapers.
    -   They raided each-other to meet the tribute demands, until some
        400 years ago, when they instead allied with each other and
        turned to raiding the Commonwealth.
    -   Their siege of Islandholme in CY 447 is a major turning point;
        their devastating defeat depletes the resources of the houses
        that mounted the attack.
    -   They turned to raiding the Ratfolk who had settled on the
        Raptor's Plane, fleeing their cruel cousins; this ended when
        they allied with the Raptors, and eventually ejected the Shaded
        Sea Peoples from Raptor's Plane.
    -   At present, they are still an active piratical and raiding
        culture, and they still have several "client" populations in the
        Shaded Sea and on Emerald Plane.

-   The Raptor's Alliance

    -   On the Raptor's Plane, in the North-West and Central regions of
        the continent.
    -   An alliance formed almost 400 years ago to resist piracy and
        raiding by Shaded Sea People.
    -   United the Raptors with Ratfolk who had settled on the
        North-West shore, fleeing the cruelty of their cousins.
    -   First contacted 300 years ago, with heavy travel beginning 200
        years ago.
    -   Friendly with the Commonwealth, though independent.
    -   May be forced into closer alliance, as they are pressured by
        Goblins on the Eastern shore and Shaded Sea peoples on the West.

-   Goblin Kings

    -   In South-East of Emerald Plain -- East of Dragonshire, South of
        Kingdoms of Men
    -   also on North-Eastern edge of the Raptor's Plane.
    -   In the past, they were a much bigger threat; the Commonwealth
        and Kingdoms have since grown militarily too powerful, and the
        Goblinoid Kingdoms have been "contained."
    -   Rather than die out, they've crossed the Gulf and begun
        colonizing the island-continent to the South.
    -   There they have subjugated several of the races they've
        encountered, and have begun to become wealthy.

[]{#anchor-11}Organizations
---------------------------

-   Commonwealth Council organizations

    -   Council Army / Navy / patrols
    -   Council Architects: originally built and maintained roads and
        bridges, now also responsible for many large public works (f.ex.
        Dams)
    -   Council Colleges: directly fund and run several colleges in
        larger towns, pay for traveling teachers to visit smaller
        communities.
    -   Council Mediators: help to settle disputes between provinces;
        disputes ultimately voted on by Commonwealth Council.

-   Professional guilds

    -   Professional guilds are a major part of the Commonwealth
        economy!
    -   Guilds provide support to tradesmen and professionals.
    -   Guilds require dues from members, and work to make sure that
        members aren't cheating the public.
    -   Guilds provide support to members, helping place apprentices
        with them, and helping them make connections to other
        professionals as they travel.

-   Religious orders

    -   usually polytheistic, help hook mortal supplicants up with any
        spirit who will make a deal
    -   since spirits are usually regional, temples usually specialize
        in spirits in the region
    -   some are devoted to pursuit of an idea, c.f. most orders that
        produce "paladins" or something like them

-   criminal organizations

    -   corruption does exist, especially in big cities
    -   Smugglers, black-mails, thugs, thieves, and everything else.

[]{#anchor-12}Languages
-----------------------

Language Outline and Rules

-   Commonwealth is wide, travel is slow; also, many tribes
    interspersed. Therefore:

    -   many different regional languages
    -   Complicated by the fact that not all races can speak
        each-others' language (c.f. Gnolls and Humans cannot make the
        same sounds, and thus cannot speak each-others\' languages)

-   Language Groups:

    -   Each language belongs to a *language group *(which represents
        the sounds needed to speak it);
    -   likewise, each race (that can talk) will have one (or more)
        language group(s) (that represent the sounds they can *make*).
    -   You can learn any language (that is, put ranks into it). You can
        understand, read and write any language you know.* But, *you can
        only *speak* a language if it is one of your race's language
        groups.
    -   So a human (group HHED) can master Heartland Gnollish (group
        GR); they will be able to understand, read and write that
        language, but they still won't be able to speak it.
    -   But, see also the Torque of Speaking (check name) in the Magic
        Items section.

-   It is actually fairly common for people in combined communities to
    be able to understand languages that they cannot speak (that is, to
    have ranks in languages not in their language group)

    -   C.F. in a combined Human and Gnollish community, many people
        might be able to understand both the local Human and Gnollish
        languages, even though Gnolls can only *speak* the gnollish one
        and humans can only *speak* the human one.

-   Some Common Language Groups:

    -   HHED: the sounds that humans, halflings, elves and dwarves can
        make
    -   GR: the sounds that Gnolls and Ratfolk can make (commonly
        described as "several coyotes having seizures")
    -   DDK: the sounds that Dragons, Drakes and Kobolds can make
        (commonly described as "a rasping song-bird")

-   10 ranks in a language is enough to assume that you can communicate
    basic concepts, given time.

    -   (NB: this is why all major characters get 10 ranks in
        Commonwealth Standard, see Character Construction.)

Some Common Languages

-   Commonwealth Standard

    -   Group: Any
    -   Attempt at a universal language
    -   Spoken language uses a small set of abstract sounds, designed to
        be very distinct. Each race picks their own sounds (which they
        can make) to use for each abstract sound.
    -   At-best-kind-of works (Language checks for spoken Commonwealth
        Standard are at -10)
    -   Commonwealth Standard as a *written* language is a huge success.
    -   Commonwealth Standard is the almost-universal written language
        for governing documents, contracts, trade -- even in the
        Kingdoms of Man, many merchants and administrators can read and
        write Commonwealth Standard.
    -   Most formal education uses texts in Commonwealth Standard, and
        therefore
    -   more people can *read and write* in Commonwealth Standard than
        in their own language's script
    -   No-one has Commonwealth Standard as a first language. Most
        people will have their own regional, racial language as a first
        language, and then possibly ranks in other common regional
        languages (so they can understand their neighbors) and possibly
        ranks in Commonwealth Standard

-   Goblin: language used throughout the Goblin Kingdoms

    -   Group HHED+GR (requires both to speak)

-   Heartland Gnoll: a derivative of the language spoke by the Gnoll
    tribe that helped found the Commonwealth. Has absorbed many idioms
    from Weal.

    -   Though Heartland Gnoll is far and away the most common GR
        language, many other tribal languages still survive in pockets.
    -   Group GR

-   Hel: common language in Northland, influenced by both Hud and Weal.

    -   Group HHED

-   High Kobold: language used by Kobolds in the Commonwealth.

    -   Derived from Old Kobold, but has become far more complex, and
        has imported words directly from Rak, and idioms from Weal and
        Islander Elvish.
    -   Group DDK

-   Hud: traditional Dwarven language, common in Northland Province.

    -   Group HHED

-   Islander Elvish: commonly spoke by the Ash Elves living on Haven
    Isle

    -   Group HHED

-   Islander: common language on the Haven Isles, influenced by Islander
    Elvish and Weal.

    -   Group HHED

-   Rak: language spoken by Dragons and Drakes in the Dragonshire

    -   Group DDK

-   Royal: Common language in the Kingdoms of Men.

    -   Derived form Imperial
    -   Group HHED

-   Weal: common language in Heartland Province.

    -   Derived from Imperial, but heavily influenced by the languages
        of other races from the interior of the continent.
    -   Group HHED

-   Old Imperial: the language that the Empire carried east.

    -   The language spoken by most Humans east of the World-Spine is
        derived from this -- but it's not a modern, living language.
    -   Notable for its aspirated H's and hard consonants.
    -   Group HHED

-   Old Kobold: original Kobold language, spoken in their ancestral home
    in Imperial territory.

[]{#anchor-13}Magic
-------------------

Magic runs throughout the world of the Commonwealth; it is produced and
consumed in countless ways, and bent to numerous ends.

All processes---especially life processes---produce a spiritual essence,
which is simply called *magic*. Get a better name. This energy can be
harnessed and put to use---although this can be difficult, given that it
is fickle and unpredictable, often following arbitrary and bizarre
rules, or operating according to no apparent law at all.

Some can learn to manipulate the magic that arises and flows around
them, producing powerful magical effects; these people are called mages,
and the powerful abilities they perfect are called spells. Others learn
to manipulate the magical energies that they produce within themselves,
granting them supernatural physical and mental abilities; these are
*psions*, and their powers are called *sleights*. Some creatures anatomy
even incorporates the presence of magic, giving them innate magical
abilities; we say these creatures are *empowered*. Sometimes, these
energies form into beings made completely of magic; we call these
Spirits (see *Spirits, *below). Some flesh-and-blood beings serve
Spirits---or broker deals with them; these are referred to as *priests*,
and any abilities or gifts the spirits grant them are called *boons*.

Magic can also be incorporated into the functions of devices, or infused
into solutions, allowing for magical tools, artifacts and potions to be
produced; the Commonwealth makes great use of simple magical devices and
potions, while extremely powerful magical artifacts are rare, highly
prized, and almost always unique.

Creatures are classified as either *natural, empowered *or *spirit*,
based on their relationship to magic; see *Characters* and *Races*.
Powers are classified as *sleights*, *spells, *or *boons* based on what
skill they rely on, from which we infer what source of magic that they
use (or as something else, like a maneuver, if they don't use a magical
source); see *Powers*.

[]{#anchor-14}Spirits
---------------------

Spirits are real and present things in the world of the
Commonwealth---to the point that you can walk directly up to them and
speak to them, although doing so can be difficult and dangerous.

Sometimes, magic forms into creatures, whether by binding to inert
matter to bring it to life, or by forming into creatures made entirely
of magical energy alone. Some such organisms are simple, analogous to
animals, while others are sophisticated, having minds equal to
flesh-and-blood beings. Some are even greater beings; immense, powerful
and mysterious, these are known as ~~Patrons~~ Great Spirits.

Spirit creatures are fueled by the energies they siphon from a
particular region or process, called their Basin. Sometimes, a Basin is
a place, like a lake or forest; sometimes, it is a large region, like
the World-Spine mountains. Sometimes it is a set of places holy to them,
which might be as broadly-construed as "all forges" or as specific as
"the spot where Lyn was slain." Other times, Basins are processes: such
as music, for example, or decay, or fire. In turn, many spirits also
have the ability to influence their Basin, granting them supernatural
abilities.

Spirit creatures are populous, almost as much so as natural creatures.
Spirit creatures frequently align themselves into clans and nations,
much like natural creatures do---with the additional complication
introduced by being bound to specific basins, which can make some
alliances tense and some conflicts inevitable.

Some Spirits are mercurial, hiding behind religions and refusing to
interact directly with flesh-and-blood beings; others, however, are very
direct, presenting themselves directly to mortals and dealing plainly
with them. (And, of course, a great many spirits have no concern for
mortal affairs at all, dealing only with other spirits.)

[]{#anchor-15}Propitiation
--------------------------

Some spirits can be *propitiated*---that is, they will do favors for
mortals that perform certain rituals or make certain offerings; we call
these spirits Patrons. As in all other things, the wants of Patrons vary
widely; some will grant simple favors in exchange for offerings of food
or song, others might demand elaborate ritual, while still others might
command much higher prices---life, treasure or blood. (Note that only
some Spirits can be propitiated; others have no particular concern for
the affairs of Natural beings---or simply don't have any useful ability
to offer.) (Making a deal with a spirit that cannot be Bound can be
dangerous; see *Binds*, below.)

To some extent, priests in Renaisance work much like brokers: they
decipher the intricate and complex details of the wants, natures and
politics of nearby Spirits, and connect flesh-and-blood supplicants to
Spirits with whom they can do business.

[]{#anchor-16}Manifestations
----------------------------

-   many spirits dwell in or near their basin (esp. if it\'s a region)

    -   that is, in the physical world, and not in some other "realm"
    -   may not physically manifest, however; they are diffuse in the
        basin
    -   may have specific form they can take

-   some spirits have holy places where they can appear
-   some spirits are connected to physical forms, and can travel about
    much like a natural creature (see f.ex. Shamblers and Tempters)
-   the dead are an exception. Dead creatures pass into a realm of
    Shade. Some specific spirits also exist in the realm of Shade
    normally.

[]{#anchor-17}Saints
--------------------

Some mortals can form special relationships with existing spirits; these
mortals are sometimes granted places as Spirits after death (as opposed
to passing into the Realm of the Dead). In principle, the
formerly-mortal Spirit then works like any other Spirit, and can act as
a free agent; Saint refers specifically to those spirits that remain
loyal to some other Spirit\'s cause. In practice, most Spirits do not
"sanctify" a mortal recklessly, and so most Saints remain loyal to their
Spirit\'s cause.

Saints frequently do not have happy histories.

[]{#anchor-18}Binds
-------------------

Binds are a major part of bargaining with the Spirits. They are also
almost a complete mystery.

A *bind* is a ritual that exerts control over a spirit; theoretically, a
bound spirit can be compelled to act in a certain way, such as
performing a service (or not doing something).

Only some Spirits have (known) binds, and any two spirits are likely to
have entirely different binds.

Binds are terribly understood. There is no known way to tell if a spirit
is bound -- or learn what its bind is, or tell if it even has one. Only
a few spirits have known Binds at all -- some skeptics even maintain
that binds do not exist -- that they are simply acts put forth to lull
mortals into trusting Spirits.

Binds can vary widely. Some require a spirit to consent to being bound
in order to be effective, while others do not. Some are simple, like
speaking a short phrase in a spirit\'s presence, while others are quite
complex, involving elaborate ceremonies or complex rituals. Likewise,
their effects and durations can vary wildly -- from compelling a spirit
to keep vigil until relieved, to preventing a spirit from lying until
the dawn, to binding a spirit to serve until released, to preventing a
spirit from touching anything orange for a week. Making things even more
complex, binds can have bizarre failure-cases and exceptions---a bind
might not work if the candles used in the ritual are made from the fat
of a mother goat and its foal, for example, or a bind might break if a
given spirit crosses running water.

Needless to say, keeping track of which spirits have known binds, how
those binds work and, importantly, if those binds have any "gotchas" is
a major and valuable occupation for the Clergy!

    -   It can grant them strength, but it demands their devotion---and
        that they maintain their place as its chosen.
    -   It usually selects the strongest people, by some definition---at
        least among those who seek its favor. Sometimes it will shift
        its favor if a people becomes too weak.
    -   Sometimes no obvious reason why its favor shifts.

    -   Pays no heed to mortals; goes about his own business, for his
        own reasons. Is uninterested in mortal affairs, and cannot be
        propitiated.
    -   When his affairs intersect with those of mortals, the results
        are mystifying, without rhyme or reason, or apparent
        motivation---and, because he is a strong spirit with a vast
        basin, the consequences for mortals are often profound.

-   The Cypress

    -   Great Spirit dwelling in the swamps and marshes in the
        south-western lowlands, which are his Basin.
    -   He likes mortals, and is happy to share his land with them.

        that his lands be preserved; however, as a social creature, he
        enjoys interacting with mortal beings.
    -   He believes that it's possible for society to expand without
        destroying nature, and seeks to preserve such a balance.
    -   Father of the Shamblers, see below.

[]{#anchor-20}Death
-------------------

Most who die pass on into the Realm of Shade, a dark and immaterial
place of which mortals know little. There is no known record of any of
the living entering or viewing it; while the spirits of the dead can be
coaxed back from it, they are frequently uncooperative. When the dead
manifest in the material world, they are frequently changed from their
former selves: they are beyond all mortal concern and consequence, and
are often aggressive, vulgar and destructive.

Investigation is further hampered because it is difficult to conjure the
spirits of the dead; it often requires the complicity of powerful
spirits to accomplish. In particular, summoning the spirit of a
*particular* deceased mortal can prove extraordinarily tricky, without a
close personal connection to the departed or the aid of a power Spirit;
those who attempt to summon the dead without one or both run the risk of
calling forth some unrelated deceased, whose only concern might be to
cause as much chaos as they can.

Some mortals have never been successfully summoned, despite repeated
attempts made by expert Clerics; it is assumed---or perhaps hoped---that
some happier fate than departure to the realm of Shade has claimed these
beings, and that they simply do not wish to return.

I need to work on this some. I'm not sure I want the setting to have a
final fate that's this bleak, but there are elements of it that I like
and that I want to keep.

[]{#anchor-21}What you do
-------------------------

This needs to go somewhere else.

-   You won\'t:

    -   raid ancient temples for artifacts: modern knowledge eclipses
        anything of past ages
    -   slay bands of robbers: large and well-funded Commonwealth
        military keeps large bandit problems from cropping up -- most of
        the time, at least
    -   slay monsters: most "monsters" are your neighbors, and the ones
        that aren\'t, the military deals with

-   You might:

    -   venture into neighboring kingdoms under cover to keep them from
        threatening you
    -   deal with local city-crime problems (gangs, the mob, or
        government corruption)
    -   deal with local tragedies in the Heartland (manors are allowed
        to collapse if they fuck up: Heartland is a little like Fantasy
        Extropia)
    -   Deal with problems caused by troublesome (or mysterious, or
        brutal) spirits

[]{#anchor-22}D-Percent System
==============================

This system is inspired by Eclipse Phase\'s D% system.

[]{#anchor-23}Some Rule 0's
---------------------------

-   When rounding, always round down.
-   Everything stacks unless it specifically says otherwise.

    -   That is, if you have several bonuses or penalties, they all
        apply; you might assume this would be the case, but it's worth
        pointing out, since some popular games don't work that way.

[]{#anchor-24}Check Basics
--------------------------

Checks are at the heart of Renaissance.

-   Roll D%, compare to *target*: succeed if less than or equal to
    target, fail otherwise

    -   Conceptually, a D% is a dice that is numbered from 0 to 99. Such
        dice exist, but you can use anything that generates a number
        from 0 to 99 in an unbiased way---like two ten-sided dice, or a
        computer.
    -   Be careful! D% runs from 0 to 99, *not* 1 to 100!

        -   this means that if you're using a computer random number
            generator and it gives you a result of 100, you should
            interpret that as 00---that is, as a critical *success*.

    -   Margin of Success (MoS) is die roll if success
    -   Margin of Failure (MoF) is (die roll -- target) if failure
    -   targets vary, but are usually either skill checks (see below) or
        some combination of your aptitudes (see Skills).

-   Target Limits:

    -   Your target can never be greater than 98; a 99 always fails, and
        is always a critical failure.
    -   Your target can never be less than 0; a 0 always succeeds, and
        is a critical success.
    -   If failure is impossible, simply waive the check, or use a
        Simple Check; if success is impossible, then simply declare that
        the character fails. See also When Should We Use Checks.

-   Special Results

    -   if you succeed and your MoS is over 30, then you have scored an
        exceptional success.
    -   If you succeed and your MoS is a "double"---that is, a multiple
        of 11---then you have scored a critical success.
    -   Likewise, if you fail and your MoF is over 30, then you have
        scored an exceptional failure, and if you fail and roll a
        double, then you have scored a critical failure.
    -   The results of this vary: some rules will spell out exactly what
        happens, while other times, it will be up to the GM's discretion
        to come up with an appropriate extra reward (for an Exceptional
        Success) or amazing bonus (for a critical success).
    -   Sometimes, for clarity, we'll call a success that is neither an
        exceptional or critical success a "normal success," and we'll
        call a failure that is neither an exceptional nor a critical
        failure a "normal failure".

-   Upgrading and Downgrading.

    -   Sometimes, you'll be able to upgrade (or required to downgrade)
        a given check.
    -   When you upgrade, your results are improved:

        -   a critical failure or exceptional failure becomes a normal
            failure
        -   a normal success becomes an exceptional success, and an
            exceptional success becomes a critical success.

    -   When you downgrade, your results are degraded:

        -   a critical success becomes an exceptional success, and an
            exceptional success becomes a normal success.
        -   A critical or exceptional success becomes a normal success.
        -   A normal failure becomes an exceptional failure, and an
            exceptional failure becomes a critical failure.

    -   Note that, when upgrading, a normal failure does not become a
        normal success, and when downgrading, a normal success does not
        become a normal failure. That would be a little too powerful!
    -   Also, your MoS and MoF don't actually change, so MoS- and
        MoF-dependant effects aren't changed.
    -   Upgrading and Downgrading are an exception to the "everything
        stacks" general rule: you can't upgrade or downgrade any one
        test more than once.

-   Skill Checks:

    -   skill checks are the most common type of check
    -   the target is: the Linked Aptitude for the skill + your Ranks in
        the skill + any modifiers
    -   For example, to if you have 40 ranks in Stealth, your
        Coordination (the linked aptitude for Stealth) is 20, and you
        have a magic cloak that gives you +20 to Stealth, then your
        target is 80; you would then roll a D100, and try to roll an 80
        or less. A 45 would succeed (Margin of Success: 45), while an 85
        would fail (Margin of Failure of 5).

-   Simple Checks: for a *simple* check, success is assumed, and you are
    only rolling to determine how well you do (for example, to determine
    how long you take, or how impressive your results are).

    -   Commonly used when a character can simply try some task again
        and again until they succeed, or when the GM decides that a
        character could not reasonably fail at a given task.
    -   In a Simple Check, compute the target the same way you would for
        a normal check.
    -   If you roll less than or equal to your target, you *excel; *if
        you roll more than your target, you *stumble*. Come up with
        better words for this FFS.
    -   If you *excel*, then you have achieved what you were trying to
        achieve, and done a good job of it!
    -   If you *stumble,* then you *still* achieve what you wanted, you
        just do so less dramatically; maybe you make some embarrassing
        mistake along the way, or it takes longer than expected.
    -   Simple success checks can't be be Exceptional or Critical.

-   Opposed:

    -   used when two characters are opposing each other.
    -   One character will *win*, and the other will *loose*.
    -   Each character makes a (separate) check.
    -   If one character succeeds and other fails check, the character
        who succeeded wins the check.
    -   if both succeed, highest Margin of Success wins (reroll ties)
    -   if both fail, reroll the check

        -   For example, if a character is trying to outrun a pursuer,
            an Opposed Test might be called for, using both character's
            Athletics.
        -   Suppose that Alice (who has 30 Somatics and 30 ranks in
            Athletics) is chasing Bob (who has 25 Somatics and 40 ranks
            in Athletics). Alice rolls her D100, and gets a result of
            32; this is less than her target of 60, so she succeeds,
            with a Margin of Success of 32. Bob, however, rolls a 73,
            which is greater than his target of 65; bob has failed, with
            a Margin of Failure of 8. Alice has won the check, and might
            catch up to Bob.

    -   The two characters don't have to use the same skill -- very
        often, they won't!

        -   For example, if someone impersonating a servant is trying to
            talk their way past a palace guard, then an opposed test
            between the impostor\'s Disguise and the guard's Read skills
            would be appropriate.

    -   Ordered Checks: Sometimes, it only makes sense to call for one
        character's check if the other character has already succeeded;
        in this case, one character should roll first, and the other
        character should only roll their check if it is needed. We call
        this an *Ordered* check.
    -   Variable Checks: Sometimes, it's possible for both characters to
        succeed on a task. When this happens, if both characters succeed
        on their checks, instead of declaring the highest MoS to be the
        winner, both characters should be awarded a partial success. We
        call this a *Variable* check.

        -   For example, if a character is trying to sneak past a guard,
            a Variable check might be called for, pitting the sneaking
            character's Stealth against the guard's Perception. If both
            characters succeed, the GM might rule that the guard hasn't
            spied the sneaking character directly, but has noticed some
            disturbance they left behind -- perhaps a window they left
            open, or some furniture they disturbed -- and has begun
            looking for an intruder.

-   Sidebar: When should we use checks?

    -   When is a check called for, and what type? This depends on the
        situation.
    -   In unstructured play, the type of *consequences* that the GM
        expects often determine the kind of check to use. If a check
        could have major consequences (like an attempt to hide an item
        you stole from the king while being searched by a guard), then a
        check is definitely called for. However, if the odds of failure
        are low, or the consequences of failure aren't interesting, then
        Simple Checks might be used, or the check might be waived
        all-together.
    -   Notably, most mundane actions don't require checks. A character
        can make the half-a-day's walk to a neighboring town, cook a
        meal or speak in a language they know without requiring a check.
    -   The rules for Initiative Order and Combat are more specific; in
        combat, the exact series of checks to use will usually be
        specified by the rules for combat, and the items and powers in
        use.
    -   Similarly, Down Time has more specific rules; see the rules for
        Down Time.

-   Sidebar: Repeated, Individual Skill Checks

    -   Sometimes, there are situations where several members of the
        party could attempt the same task in sequence; for example, if
        the players are trying to search a room, then each person could
        make their own Search test, one after the other.
    -   This is usually not a good idea; this makes it very difficult
        for the party to fail, since they'll have several separate
        attempts; it makes each individual test less interesting, since
        the next person will just try if the current person fails; and
        it can slow the game down dramatically.
    -   Instead, we recommend the GM require one character make one test
        on behalf of the party; that character---usually the one with
        the highest rating in the skill in question---should "take the
        lead," and the other party-members should assist (at least, the
        ones that are *eligible* to assist, see *Skill Modifiers*).

[]{#anchor-25}Modifiers
-----------------------

-   Being assisted: +10 per character assisting, maximum +30. Assisting
    characters must have 10 Ranks in a useful skill (but it doesn\'t
    have to be the *same* skill). The GM may rule that certain tests
    cannot be *assisted*. (Attack Tests cannot be assisted, but see the
    Soldier class.)
-   -10 for Trying Again. The GM determines if you can *try again*.

    -   This rule dose not apply to attacking a target in combat.

-   Related Skill:

    -   receive a bonus on one Test for having ranks in a related skill
        (for example, Knowledge: Theology might assist Profession:
        Cleric)
    -   10-25 Ranks: +10
    -   25-40 Ranks: +20
    -   41+ Ranks: +30
    -   You may only use one related skill.

-   Specialization:

    -   skills can have *specializations*.
    -   Character recieves +10 when Specialization applies; there is *no
        effect *(including *no penalty*) when Specialization does not
        apply
    -   Any given skill can only be specialized once. You can't buy both
        a \[Short Swords\] and a \[Knives\] Specialization for Bladed
        Weapons, for example.
    -   You can acquire specializations for your skills during character
        creation: see also *Character Creation*.

-   Clarification: you can also acquire specializations for field
    skills, for example:\
    Art: Painting \[Landscapes\], where Art is a field skill, Painting
    is the field, and \[Landscapes\] is the specialization.
-   Difficulty Modifiers

    -   Run from Very Easy (+30) to Very Hard (-30), and all shades
        in-between.

-   Taking your Time and Rushing:

    -   only applies to Task Actions and Jobs
    -   Taking your Time: for every +50% increase in timeframe, +10 to
        the check (up to +150% time for +30)
    -   Rushing: for every -25% *reduction* in timeframe, -10 to the
        check (up to -75% for -30)

-   Situational Modifiers

    -   Lots of other things might provide modifiers! The GM may assign
        modifiers from situation as appropriate.

-   Passive Tests: Usually, characters will use their skills actively.
    Sometimes, the GM will roll a test on behalf of the player---for
    example, to see if they have noticed something (a Perception test),
    realized something (a COG\*3 test), or has some piece of knowledge
    (a Profession, Craft or Knowledge check). These are *Passive Tests*,
    since they are made "automatically" on the player's behalf. Passive
    checks have a -20 penalty (the players should be proactive in using
    their skills, after all). Generally, Passive tests are made in
    secret by the GM; if a player later makes an appropriate test, then
    the result of the test that the player made takes precedence
    (although events may unfold in such a way that a player cannot call
    for such a check later).
-   Common Knowledge: if a player has 10 or more ranks in a given skill,
    they can be assumed to have common knowledge appropriate to that
    skill (that is, without being required to make a test).

[]{#anchor-26}Actions
---------------------

Types of actions

-   Standard actions

    -   An action that doesn't take much time, but that you need to
        focus on.
    -   Examples: attacking with a weapon, knocking over a dresser,
        kicking in a door.

-   Quick actions

    -   An action that doesn't take much time, and that you don't need
        to focus on.
    -   Examples: moving, yelling something, retrieving a stored item,
        drawing a weapon.

-   Task actions

    -   An action that takes time (but less than a day), and that you
        need to focus on.
    -   Examples: brewing a potion, picking a lock, buying goods in town
    -   Note: Tasks that take 8 hours of work or more should generally
        be handled as Jobs and done during Down-Time.

-   Sustained actions

    -   An action that takes time, but that you don't need to focus on,
        so you can do it while doing something else.
    -   Examples: keeping an eye out for a mark during an opera, leaving
        a trail of bread-crumbs while traveling, memorizing a route
        while being forced to march, *sustaining powers.*
    -   You can take other actions while maintaining a Sustained Action,
        and you can maintain more than one Sustain action at a time.

        -   However, maintaining multiple Sustained Actions is
            distracting; you take a -10 penalty to all tests for each
            Sustained Action you maintain beyond the first.
        -   So, for example, if you maintain three Sustained Actions,
            you take a -20 penalty to all tests.

    -   Sustain actions don\'t have a specific upper limit for how long
        you can maintain them, but your GM might not allow you to
        maintain them for more than a reasonable amount of time, or
        might require additional checks or impose additional
        consequences.

-   Jobs

    -   Jobs have time-frames measured in *shifts.* A shift is one
        continuous eight-hour work day.
    -   Used mainly during Down-Time Play

-   Since the MoS (and MoF) of a test can determine how long an action
    takes, If a Task Action or Job requires a check, that check should
    be made when the action is *begun.*

    -   If the check is failed, the character in question works for 25%
        of the Task Action's timeframe or Job's shifts (on a Failure),
        or 50% (on an Exceptional Failure), before realizing that the
        task will fail (and, presumably, stopping).

[]{#anchor-27}Modes of Play
---------------------------

Renaissance has the following modes of play

-   Unstructured: the "normal" mode, which works like a conversation
    with the GM

    -   GM describes scene / situation
    -   players ask questions, declare actions
    -   GM answers questions, resolves player actions; often calls for
        tests.
    -   As the name implies, no particular rules about action allotment
        (as opposed to Turn Order and Down-Time). However, the GM may
        limit the actions allowed in a given situation (for example, you
        can't try to build a tool as a one-hour Task Action if you're in
        a building that's burning down.)

-   Turn Order: each player rolls *initiative*, and gets a turn in order
    of their initiative (Highest initiative roll first, and then in
    descending order. GM breaks ties arbitrarily, but generally a good
    idea to let highest base-initiative go first.)

    -   Initiative is 1d10 + *Initiative Modifier*. The GM will pick an
        appropriate *Initiative Modifier*.
    -   Each turn should have a specific *action allotment*, which the
        GM will pick when Turn Order play is begun.

        -   If the GM includes Task Actions in the action allotment,
            then the GM should specify *how much time* a character can
            contribute to a Task Action -- for example, "Five minute
            task actions".
        -   If the GM doesn't include Task Actions in the action
            allotment, then progress towards Task Actions are not
            tracked; a player who wishes to continue working on a Task
            Action simply looses their turn(s).
        -   Likewise, Jobs aren't tracked during Turn Order; a player
            who wants to keep working on a Job during Turn Order simply
            looses their turn(s).

    -   Combat is a special case of Turn Order play; see *Combat*,
        below.

-   Down-Time: focuses on long-term actions. Down-Time is measured in*
    *days. On any day, a character can spend 8 hours working on a Job;
    if they do, that Job is one Shift closer to being complete.

    -   Your GM might allow you to work more or less time, and to earn
        shifts slower or quicker; this is entirely at GM discretion.

        -   In particular, races that don't need to sleep have an
            obvious opportunity to earn more than one Shift in a day.

    -   As an alternative to working on a Job, a player can spend a day
        to complete one or more task actions (recall that Task Actions
        should take less than 8 hours, so you should always be able to
        finish at least one Task Action per day).

-   Sidebar: Interrupting Actions

    -   Sometimes it's possible to interrupt an action---if one
        character breaks into the workshop where another character is
        working, for example. We don't provide fixed rules for this,
        because no set of rules could be comprehensive without being
        unwieldy. GMs are encouraged to adjudicate such situations as
        they arise.

[]{#anchor-28}Combat
--------------------

Combat is a special case of Turn Order play, using the following rules:

-   Initiative Modifier: your initiative modifier (INIT) is (INT + REF)
    ÷ 5

    -   see the Derived Stat in *Character Creation*.

-   Action allotment

    -   one Standard Action and one Quick Action, or
    -   three Quick Actions
    -   since Task Actions are not given in the action allotment, Task
        Actions are not tracked during Combat; see *Turn Order Play*.

-   If you are maintaining any Sustained Actions, you must spend one
    Quick Action to do so (meaning you would normally have either one
    Standard Action or two Quick Actions remaining),

    -   but, you only need to spend one Quick Action, no matter how many
        Sustained Actions you are maintaining.

-   In combat, a turn is about 3 seconds; therefore, there are 20 turns
    in a minute.
-   Unlike many other areas of the game, Combat has fairly specific
    rules about what characters can and cannot do.

### []{#anchor-29}Useful Terms

-   These aren't really useful here, but having them defined will make
    some powers a little easier to write. Remove / move?
-   Threatened: we say that you *threaten* an opponent if you could make
    a melee attack against them; you usually threaten opponents if they
    are next to you.
-   Bloodied: we say that a character is *bloodied* if they have taken
    DV exceeding half their DUR.

### []{#anchor-30}The Combat Grid and Movement

-   Combat Grid

    -   positions in combat are usually tracked using a *square grid*,
        with each square representing a 1 meter square.
    -   Most creatures (those that are Small-, Normal- or Large-sized)
        usually take up one square, and can reach the adjacent squares
        (to attack them, for example).
    -   Distances (like ranges) are usually measured directly and then
        rounded to the nearest whole meter. Distance while moving
        depends on the exact path traveled (in this case, "diagonal
        steps" count as traveling 1.5 meters).
    -   Traditionally, *facing* is not tracked.
    -   Though we will assume a combat grid with one-meter squares in
        this guide, nothing prevents you from using other combat
        systems---like hex-grids or miniatures---as long as the rules
        for measuring distance, determining reach and tracking movement
        are well-defined.

-   Movement

    -   Collectively, the following are called Movement Actions. You may
        only use one Movement Action during your turn.
    -   As a quick action, you may *move*: you may move up to your base
        movement rate.
    -   As a quick action, you may *move quickly*: you may move up to
        your full movement rate. After doing so, you suffer a -10
        penalty to all Physical skill tests until your next turn.
    -   As a quick action, you may *charge*: you may move up to your
        full movement rate, and you suffer a -10 penalty to all Physical
        skill tests until your next turn. See *Charging* and *Bracing*
        below for more information.
    -   You may also perform *Stunts*.

        -   "Stunts" are used when your character attempts unusual,
            difficult maneuvers---they jump, tumble, flip, climb (if
            they don't have a climb speed), swing and so on.
        -   The type of action varies: rolling under a hazard might be a
            quick action, but climbing a trellis might be a standard
            action (for a character without a climb speed).
        -   How far the character is moved will also vary (in general,
            GMs should move characters by either their base or full
            rates).
        -   Stunts almost always require a test using an appropriate
            movement skill (this is usually Athletics for humanoid
            creatures).
        -   Stunts may have other affects as well (a dive-and-roll may
            allow you to end your turn prone behind cover, a flip off a
            table may allow you to cross over an enemy and land facing
            their back).

### []{#anchor-31}Attacking

-   Attacking a target

    -   a Standard Action (whether in melee or using a ranged weapon)
    -   roll an Ordered Opposed Check, first the attacker and then the
        defender

        -   Attacker Wins: Defender takes attack damage (listed damage
            for a weapon or power)
        -   Defender Wins: Defender takes no damage

    -   Exceptional Results:

        -   Attacker MoS \> 30: +5 DV
        -   Attacker MoS \> 60: +5 more DV (+10 DV total)
        -   Attacker critical success:s

            -   ~~ignore defender\'s armor.~~ This might be a little
                strong; they did away with this in EP2, for example. And
                I might also add rules for deliberately targeting a weak
                spot, which would make this sort of redundant.
            -   Roll damage dice twice, take best result. I like that
                better.

    -   Attack Skills: use the attack skill appropriate to the weapon;
        some attacks will specify an Attack Skill.
    -   Defense Skills: you can defend with many different skills

        -   Fray is the most general defense skill. It can be used to
            defend against most attacks. (Among it's other uses, see
            Skills).
        -   You can use your own melee attack skills to defend against
            melee attacks---you can use your Bladed Weapons to defend
            against someone attacking with Pole Arms, for example. This
            represents you parrying or deflecting their attacks.

            -   Since Unarmed is a melee attack skill, you can use it to
                defend; see Unarmed Combat for more information.

        -   Sometimes---when using the Weave power, for example---you
            can defend with movement skills, like Athletics.

-   Ranged Attacks: ranged attacks (projectiles, thrown weapons and some
    powers) use the rules for *attacking a target*, with the following
    addition:

    -   Range: ranged attacks have range categories: you are in a given
        range category if your distance to the target is the listed
        distance or less. Each range category has a modifier, which
        applies to the attack test:

        -   short: no modifier
        -   medium: -10
        -   long: -20
        -   extreme: -30

    -   base ranges for throwing things:

        -   short: up to 5 meters
        -   medium: up to 15m
        -   long: up to 30m
        -   extreme: up to 45m
        -   adjust for weight, aerodynamics of object

    -   Scatter: ranged attacks may scatter.

        -   Multiple methods for scatter, like EP.
        -   Method 1: roll 2d10. One d10 indicates the scatter direction
            (there are 8 adjacent squares, so discard 9 and 10 results),
            the other the distance (in meters).
        -   Method 2: with a physical table, roll 1d10. The result is
            the distance in meters, and the direction the dice is
            pointing indicates the scatter direction.
        -   Scatter is mainly a concern when the weapon also has the
            Blast property; you usually don't worry about where an arrow
            scatters to.

-   Touch-Only Attacks: sometimes, notably when using some powers, an
    attacker only needs to touch their target.

    -   Treat this as an attack against the target, using the attacker's
        Unarmed skill; the attacker gets a +COO bonus, and the defender
        takes a -30 penalty.
    -   Treat this as an attack, using the standard rules. The attacker
        may use either COO+REF+SOM or their Unarmed Combat; they receive
        a +20 bonus. The defender takes a -20 penalty.

-   Indicate-Only Attacks: sometimes, notably when using some Powers, an
    attacker only needs to direct an effect to a target -- by pointing
    at the target, for example, or fixing their gaze on the target.

    -   Treat this as a ranged attack against the target, using the
        attacker's Projectile Weapons skill; the attacker gets a +COO
        bonus, and the defender takes a -30 penalty.
    -   Treat this as a ranged attack, using the standard rules. The
        attacker may use either COO+COO+REF, their Projectile Weapons
        skill or their Thrown Weapons skill; they receive a +20 bonus.
        The defender takes a -20 penalty.

-   Still working on these two. I'm torn between the roll needing to be
    make-able, especially to a caster-character that might have bad
    physical stats -- but at the same time, I don't want to stick them
    with a raw ability check that they can't use ranks to improve. And
    if we can manage to sync the rules up, so much the better.

    -   One thing I particularly want to avoid are two checks that both
        have low odds of success, so you just have to keep re-rolling
        them. And if a caster character has lousy physical stats,
        COO+REF+SOM might be 30 or so, which is low.
    -   But I also don't want to saddle casters with a "pointing skill"
        that only they have to spend ranks on.
    -   I took the rules I just had and added a +20 bonus; that will be
        close enough for the next play session.
    -   Does anyone have any feedback on these?

-   Un-Aware Target: targets who are not aware that they are being
    attacked cannot defend. (The attacker must still roll to hit their
    target.) (PCs and major NPCs should usually be allowed a Perception
    Check to notice a hidden attacker. Also, people usually take notice
    after they have been attacked.)

### []{#anchor-32}Armor and Armor Penetration

-   Armor and Armor Penetration: if the defender has Armor, subtract
    their (total) Armor Rating from the attack\'s DV. However, if the
    attack has Armor Penetration (AP) -- usually because the weapon in
    use has armor penetration -- subtract the Armor Penetration from the
    Armor. Armor Penetration and Damage Values can\'t be negative.

    -   Damage inflicted is then: DV -- (Armor -- Armor Penetration)

-   Armor Penalty: some armors have a listed Armor Penalty; you take the
    listed penalty while wearing the armor.

    -   Didn't get good feedback on people with heavy armor having a
        skill penalty; we need to figure out some other mechanism.

### []{#anchor-33}Strikes and Maneuvers

The combat system in Renaissance is intended to be light-weight and
flexible; characters should be able to attempt a variety of attacks,
maneuvers and tricks, and GMs (ideally) should adjudicate these
on-the-fly. *However,* players and Gms both can benefit greatly from
some guidance on the kinds of things that are possible; we therefore
refer you to the *Special Attacks* section in *Alternate Rules: *those
rules are optional, but *useful* and *recommended*.

-   Any skilled melee combatant will have developed a repertoire of
    useful tricks, more than simply *sticking pointy end in other
    fighter.* We call these *strikes* and *maneuvers*.

    -   A *strike* is a modification to a normal attack. To make a
        strike, you take a penalty on your attack; if you score an
        Exceptional Success, in addition to the normal affects of the
        attack, you gain the listed Result.

        -   You decide if your attack is going to be a strike before you
            make it (since you have to take a penalty on the attack).
        -   An attack can only be one kind of Strike. (You can't take a
            -20 penalty to have an attac be both a Called Shot an Knock
            Down.)

    -   A *maneuver* isn't made as part of an attack.

        -   Each maneuver will list the type of action required, the
            check, and the result if you succeed.

-   Strikes:

    -   Called Shot

        -   Penalty: -10
        -   Result: you strike the target in a specified location (you
            pick the location before your attack).
        -   This one is a catch-all, with results up to the GM.
        -   Special: the attack gains the Precision tag

    -   Knock Down

        -   Penalty: -10
        -   Result: your opponent must attempt a SOM×2 check or be
            knocked *prone*.
        -   Special: must be a melee attack.

    -   Maim

        -   Penalty: -20
        -   Result: You maim your opponent, removing a specific limb.
            You can use this to lop off a hand, break a knee or gouge
            out an eye.
        -   Special: the attack gains the Precision tag.

    -   Mighty Blow

        -   Penalty: -10
        -   Result: You strike your opponent with particular force; you
            gain +DB to your DV.
        -   Special: must be a melee attack.

    -   Strike an Armor Gap

        -   Penalty: -10
        -   Result: You strike a weak spot in the opponent's Armor; you
            gain +DB to your AP.
        -   Special: the attack gains the Precision tag.

-   Maneuvers:

    -   Disarm

        -   Action: Standard Action
        -   Test: Your melee attack skill vs. target's melee attack
            skill or Fray
        -   Result: If you succeed, then you disarm your opponent,
            forcing them to drop one held item (like a weapon or
            shield).

    -   Feint

        -   Action: Quick Action
        -   Test: Your Deception vs. target's Resist Social Manipulation
            or Read
        -   Result: until the beginning of their next turn, the target
            takes a -20 penalty to their defense.

    -   Grabbing

        -   Action: Standard Action
        -   Test: your Unarmed Combat vs. target's Fray or Unarmed
            Combat.
        -   Result: you grab the opponent, impeding them. They cannot
            easily act.
        -   The results are at the GM's discretion, but normally grabbed
            characters cannot take any other actions besides attempting
            to escape the grab.
        -   A grabbed character can attempt to break a grapple, using
            either their Unarmed Combat or their STR+SOM, versus the
            Unarmed Combat of the character grabbing them. If they win,
            they break free.

    -   Trip

        -   Action: Standard Action
        -   Test: your melee attack skill vs. target's Fray
        -   Result: You trip your opponent, causing them to fall prone.

-   Examples

    -   A goblin gang-member has figured out that she cannot get past
        Chandra's armor, so she decides to *strike an armor gap.* She
        attacks Chandra, rolling her Bladed Weapons (normally 60, but 50
        with the penalty for the trick) against Chandra's Fray (60). The
        goblin ganger rolls a 21, and Chandra rolls a 73; the Goblin
        hits Chandra and deals damage like normal, but she doesn't get
        the bonus to AP she was hoping for, since she didn't score an
        Exceptional Success.
    -   Track is fighting a monster that attacked the party in a frozen
        monastery. The fight isn't going well, so he decides he needs to
        knock it down and get away. He tries to Knock it Down, and rolls
        his Blunt Weapons (normally a 70, but a 60 with the penalty for
        the trick) against it's Fray (70). He scores a 41, and the
        monster scores a 13; Track gets to deal his normal
        damage---including the +5 bonus for scoring an exceptional
        success---and then the monster has to roll its SOM×2 or be
        knocked prone.
    -   Note: there's no reason you can't spend moxie on these checks.
        As an example: Alexis has snuck up behind a watchman guarding a
        slaver encampment; she wants to dispatch him quickly, so she
        decides to throw a knife at his neck using Maim. She rolls her
        Thrown Weapons (normally 60, but 40 with the penalty), and gets
        a 21: she hit him, but she didn't strike the mortal blow she
        wanted. (He doesn't get to defend, because he's un-aware of her,
        see Un-Aware Target below.) She decides she really needs to
        dispatch him, so she spends a Luck to upgrade her attack to an
        Exceptional Success; now, not only will she get the +5 DV for an
        exceptional success, but she's hit him in the neck---a fatal
        blow!

### []{#anchor-34}Multiple Weapons and Multiple Attacks

-   Multiple Attacks: under some circumstances, characters can make
    multiple attacks (when wielding multiple weapons, for example). When
    a character attacks, they may make one attack with each weapon they
    are wielding; such an attack is still one Standard Action. Resolve
    each attack separately, using the normal procedure for each attack.
    When making Multiple Attacks, each attack suffers a -10 penalty.

    -   Multiple Targets: when making multiple attacks, each attack can
        have a different target. When attacking multiple targets, each
        attack suffers an additional -10 penalty.

        -   I'm trying to decide if I should word this as a general
            rule, or just make it specific to when you're also making
            Multiple Attacks. The only other time I can see it applying
            is for a Cleave-like power.
        -   Clarification: attacks with the Blast property are not
            considered "multiple-target attacks".

-   Off-Hand Weapons: most characters (i.e. those without an appropriate
    Trait or Racial ability) have a dominant hand and an off-hand.
    Attacks made with the off-hand suffer a -10 penalty.

    -   If the weapon you are using in your off-hand does not have the
        *off-hand* tag, you suffer an additional -10 penalty

-   Some Examples:

    -   If you're humanoid, you have the Ambidextrous trait and you are
        wielding two one-handed weapons, then you can make two separate
        attacks against one target as a Standard Action. Each attack
        suffers -10 penalty (for making Multiple Attacks).
    -   If you don't have the Ambidextrous trait, but the weapon in your
        off hand has the Off-Hand tag, then it's one attack at -10 (the
        main hand, with the Multiple Attacks penalty) and one attack at
        -20 (the off-hand, with the Off-Hand and Multiple Attacks
        penalties).
    -   If you don't have the Ambidextrous trait, and you're holding two
        one-handed-but-not-off-hand weapons, you can still choose to
        make only one attack, and that attack will have no penalty (main
        hand), or a -20 penalty
        (off-hand-attack-without-offhand-tagged-weapon, if you make your
        one attack with your off hand, for some reason).

-   Feedback required!

    -   These rules are complicated and have lots of cumulative
        penalties; carefully watch how this works out.

### []{#anchor-35}Resistance and Vulnerability

-   Resistance and Vulnerability:

    -   some creature, objects or armors will have a Resistances and
        Vulnerabilities
    -   The Resistance or Vulnerability will name the keywords to which
        they apply -- for example, Resistance: Fire or Vulnerability:
        Cold. If an attack is *resisted*, then its effects are reduced;
        if a creature is *vulnerable* to an attack, then its affects
        will be increased.
    -   Option 1:

        -   Attacks, powers and other affects will specify what happens
            when they are *resisted*, or when a target is *vulnerable*
            to them.
        -   Normally, if an attack does DV, then:

            -   the DV is *halved* if it is *resisted*, or
            -   the DV will be *doubled *if the target is *vulnerable*.

        -   In some ways the ideal version, but bad because now every
            power has to have Resist and Vulnerable lines; just don't
            wanna fuck with it.

    -   Option 2: if the target is Vulnerable, they get -20 to their
        check; if they are Resistant, they get a +20 bonus. That spare
        me having to do Vulnerable and Resisted lines for each power.

        -   Problem is that some powers don't have checks. Also it's
            just not very exciting.

    -   Option 3:

        -   ~~if the defender is Vulnerable to a power, then Success are
            treated as Exceptional Successes, and Exceptional Successes
            are treated as Criticals.~~ If the defender is vulnerable to
            an attack, effect or power, then the attacker's checks are
            Upgraded.
        -   ~~If the defender is Resistant to an effect, then
            Exceptional Successes and Criticals are treated as regular
            Successes.~~ If the defender is Resistant to an effect, then
            the attacker's checs are Downgraded.
        -   This sounds both Exciting and Easy without introducing new
            rules, but it's vulnerable to the same thing that Option 2
            is; not every power will have a check (or a specific result
            on a critical).

    -   Option 4

        -   D&D 5 stye
        -   if you resist, roll damage dice twice and take the lowest.
        -   If you are vulnerable, roll damage dice twice and take the
            highest.

### []{#anchor-36}And Unsorted Rules

-   Full Defense: during your turn, you may take a Standard Action to
    focus on defending yourself. If you do, until your next turn starts,
    you receive a +10 bonus when you Defend.

    -   Nobody did this either, and it's also now covered by the Weave
        power.
    -   Someone, I think Sauce, suggested I add it back. I'd like to
        keep the rules as simple as possible, and this is a real corner
        case, but if people think it might be useful, I'll un-remove it.

-   Blast: a Blast Attack (an Attack with the Blast property) does its
    listed damage at the center of the blast, and 2 DV less for every
    meter away from the center. (In this way, the DV scored by the
    attack determines the radius of the blast.)

    -   People in area of affect of a Blast Attack usually will not be
        able to Defend -- you're either in the explosion or you aren't!

-   Splash: similar to Blast attacks, some attacks cover an area, but do
    not directly cause damage (a thrown jar of Scour, for example; see
    Items). Attacks with the Splash property cover a given area (like
    1D10 meters).

    -   Like Blast attacks, creatures in the area of a Splash Attack
        cannot usually defend.

-   Point-Blank Attacks: using a Thrown or Projectile Weapon at
    point-blank range (that is, against a target in an adjacent space)
    gets a -20 penalty
-   Grabbing: as a Standard Action, a character may attempt to *grab*
    another character. Make an attack test using your Unarmed Combat
    skill: if you succeed and your MoS exceeds the target's STR, then,
    instead of doing damage, you *grab* the opponent. A grabbed opponent
    normally cannot take physical actions (beyond attempting to escape
    the grab). Attempting to escape the grab is a standard action
    requiring an opposed check, with escaping character using either
    their Unarmed Combat or their STR+SOM against the grabber's Unarmed
    Combat.

    -   We do not attempt to provide extensive rules for grabbing and
        grappling; your GM may apply additional affects, modifiers and
        penalties as appropriate to the situation.

-   Size and Combat

    -   Ranged attacks against *small* targets receive a -10 penalty;
        however, attempts to grapple small targets are made at +10.
    -   Ranged attacks against *large* targets receive a +10 bonus;
        however, attempts to grapple large targets are made at -10.
    -   Greater bonuses and penalties may be used for larger size
        differences.
    -   see *Sizes*

-   Natural Attacks: Natural Attacks are attacks made with "weapons"
    with the Natural tag (which is to say, claws, bites and so on).
    Natural attacks use the same rules as attacks with weapons.

    -   Clarification: most Natural Attacks have the off-hand tag. This
        is the same off-hand tag that light weapons have; it means that
        the Natural Attack does not suffer the additional -10 penalty
        when made with a non-dominant hand.
    -   *This could use some adjustment; feedback is appreciated.*

-   Unarmed Combat:

    -   Unarmed Attacks have a base DV of 1d10+DB (Damage Bonus, see
        *Vital Statistics*), with no AP.

        -   Unarmed Attacks have the Natural and Off-Hand tags.
        -   Unarmed Attacks are punches, kicks and other similar
            attacks. Mechanically, they are those that are made without
            a Weapon or a listed Natural Attack.

    -   An Unarmed Attack made against an opponent with a weapon (or
        natural attack) suffers a -10 penalty.
    -   When using the Unarmed skill to defend against a weapon or
        natural attack, you take a -10 penalty.
    -   I'm not actually sure I want or need either of those rules.

-   Charge: when you use the Charge move action, if you end your move at
    least (twice your walking rate) from where you started, then you
    gain +DB DV on your attacks for the rest of your turn.

    -   This is still more awkward than I want it to be, but it's
        getting there.

-   Brace: Weapons with the Brace tag can be used to prepare to receive
    a charge.

    -   You need to have a weapon with the Brace tag.
    -   Bracing to receive a charge is a Standard Action.
    -   After bracing, until your next turn, if anyone *charges* you
        (see *Charge* above), you may attack them first, before they
        attack you. (Resolve the attack normally; the charging character
        can still defend, for example.)
    -   If you hit the charging character, you deal +DB damage.
    -   You do not prevent them from completing the charge (by attacking
        you), unless you incapacitate them with your attack (by
        disabling them, or by dealing a wound and knocking them prone,
        for example).

-   Prone:

    -   You may drop prone as a Quick Action.
    -   Some effects will force you to become prone (without requiring
        an action).

        -   Like failing a SOM×3 check after being wounded, or being
            tripped.

    -   Getting up from a prone position is a Quick Action.
    -   While prone,

        -   you may move up to your Walking movement as a Standard
            Action,
        -   melee attackers receive a +10 bonus against you, and
        -   ranged attackers take a -10 penalty against you.

[]{#anchor-37}Injury
--------------------

We use the same rules for taking damage, regardless of if the damage is
inflicted by a weapon attack, a disease, or something else.

Characters who are injured receive Damage, in an amount given by the
source\'s Damage Value (DV). (If you are attacked by a weapon, this
would be the weapon\'s DV, for example.) When the amount of damage that
you have taken equals your DUR, you are disabled; you are too badly
injured to take action, and likely unconscious. When the amount of
damage that you have taken reaches your Death Rating (DR), your
character has been killed.

Any time you take damage, you might also suffer *wounds*. If the amount
of damage you take at one time exceeds your Wound Threshold, then one
wound is inflicted. If you take damage that equals or exceeds twice your
Wound Threshold, you take two wounds, and so on; so, if your DUR was 30
and your WT was 6, and you then took 15 damage, you would also take 2
wounds.

When a wound is inflicted, you must roll SOM \*3; if you fail, you are
knocked down.

For every wound that has been inflicted, you suffer a -10 penalty to all
actions (not just physical actions, since wounds are painful and
distracting). Specific wounds might inflict other effects, as determined
by the GM; a wound to the head might render you unconscious, for
example.

Sometimes, you will have the ability to *Negate* a wound. When this
happens, you may ignore the -10 penalty inflicted by that one wound.
Note that the wound is not healed, you are simply not hindered by it.
Only the -10 penalty is negated, any other effects persist; you cannot,
for example, *negate* having your hand chopped off in order to wield a
two-handed weapon.

Mental stress works much like physical damage. Difficult circumstances
can inflict *stress *according to their Stress Value (SV); when your
stress exceeds your Lucidity (LUC), your character succumbs to the
enormous strains they are under; they cannot act until their Stress is
lowered below their Lucidity. If your stress exceeds your Insanity
Rating (IR), your character is irreparably traumatized (they are removed
from the game as surely as if they had died).

If you receive stress at one time that exceeds you Trauma Threshold
(TT), you suffer a Trauma. (Like wounds, you can receive multiple
Traumas at a time, if you receive enough Stress at one time to exceed a
multiple of your Trauma Threshold.) Like Wounds, you suffer a -10
penalty to all actions for each Trauma that you have. When you receive a
Trauma, you must roll WIL\*3 or be stunned for one round.

When stress is inflicted, characters may roll WIL \* 3. If they succeed,
they are not affected; if they fail, they take the given Stress value.
Some sources of stress have two Stress Values, one that is taken if the
WIL \* 3 check is failed (like normal), and one (usually lesser) Stress
Value that is inflicted *even if the check is passed*.

Like wounds, the GM may sometimes decide that a Trauma has a specific
effect on a character -- such as the overpower urge to avoid the source
of Stress that caused the Trauma. These effects are generally meant to
be roll-played. These effects generally last until the Trauma itself has
been healed.

The penalties from Traumas and Wounds stack. Like wounds, sometimes
Traumas can be *negated*. When this occurs, the Trauma is not healed,
the character is simply able to function effectively in spite of it.

[]{#anchor-38}Healing
---------------------

-   Characters heal naturally:

    -   1 DV per Day. One Wound per week that you do not receive any DV,
        after all DV has been healed.
    -   1 SV per Day. One Trauma per month that you do not receive any
        SV, after all SV has been healed.

-   See also *Fast Healing*, in *Abilities*
-   Binding Wounds: characters can use Medicine to attempt to treat and
    bind wounds.

    -   This is a Medicine Task Action with a time frame of 10 minutes.
    -   Roll Medicine: on a success, recover 1d10 DV, and you *negate
        *one wound
    -   (the wound must ultimately heal naturally)
    -   This check may only be attempted once per wound.

-   Long-Term Care

    -   A character who rests and receives care heals more quickly.
    -   Instead of their natural healing, for each day a character
        spends resting and recovering, they recover 3 DV; they heal one
        wound every 4 days, after all damage has been healed.
    -   Likewise, a character who spends time resting and processing
        their traumas recovers more quickly.
    -   Instead of their natural healing, they heal 3 SV per day. They
        heal one Trauma in one week, after all stress has been healed.
    -   Long-Term Care could provide physical care, mental care or both.
        A character convalescing at a peaceful temple could receive both
        physical and mental care at the same time, for example.

-   Some Powers and Items also provide physical or mental healing; each
    Item or Power will have its own rules for doing so.

[]{#anchor-39}Conditions, Potions, Poisons and Diseases
-------------------------------------------------------

### []{#anchor-40}conditions

-   I'm not sure if I actually need rules for this; I want to keep the
    number of "rules and systems" to the minimum necessary. And if I add
    rules for conditions, then everything that could be a condition
    should be---and I don't want to commit to that.
-   Conditions have *effects* that persist while the condition applies
    to you, and rules for *removing* the condition it (which might be as
    simple as a *duration, *after which the condition ends).
-   Bleeding:

    -   effects:

        -   1 DV every minute.
        -   Bleeding characters are easy to follow; pursuers gain a +20
            bonus on Search and Perception checks.

    -   end:

        -   successful First Aid check, as a 1 minute Task Action

### []{#anchor-41}Potions and Poisons

-   Both are chemicals that affect characters.
-   Both have *effects* which persists for the potion or poison's
    *duration*.
-   They may have an *onset time* before the effects occur, and they may
    allow *resistance checks* to partially resist the potion's effects.
-   Potions:

    -   are usually beneficial, and
    -   are usually drunk (you can retrieve and drink a potion as a
        Quick Action).

-   Poisons:

    -   are usually harmful, and
    -   are often either added to food or drink, or are coated on
        weapons.
    -   If a poison is coated on a weapon, then, on the first attack
        that causes a wound,

        -   the wounded target is effected by the poison, and
        -   the poison on the weapon is consumed
        -   (traces may linger, so handling the weapon may be dangerous,
            and the poison may still be detectable if the weapon is
            examined).

-   For sample Potions and Poisons, see the *Items* section.

### []{#anchor-42}Diseases

-   Diseases have an *resistance check*, and *onset time,* a *duration,
    effects* and possibly *treatment*.
-   Some diseases may have effects based on how long the character has
    been infected---that is, the effects may proceed through *stages*.
-   When a character is first exposed to a disease, they make their
    *resistance check*; if they succeed, then they have not been
    infected.
-   If infected, once the *onset time* has passed, the symptoms of the
    disease manifest; at this point, the *effects* of the disease apply.
-   The symptoms then last for the *duration*; once this has passed, the
    disease and its effects end.
-   Finally, some diseases have a specific *treatment*. The effects of
    treatment vary, ranging from curing the disease entirely, to
    allowing an additional Resistance check, to shortening the duration.

    -   Of course, some powers, potions and means magical and medical
        can also be used to cure diseases.

-   Characters can be deliberately exposed to disease: weapons can be
    coated with the blood and viscera of the infected, food can be made
    from tainted meat, and the infected can choose to enter and mingle
    among a population to spread their disease, for example.

-   Flu

    -   Resistance: DUR × 2
    -   Onset: 1 Day
    -   Duration: 3 Days
    -   Effects: fatigue, aches and nausia

-   Black Death

    -   Resistance: DUR
    -   Onset: 3 Days
    -   Duration: 1 week
    -   Effect: high fever, delerium, unconsciousness; 1d10 DV / day

-   Raking Cough

    -   Resistance: DUR × 2
    -   Onset: 1 Month
    -   Duration: permanent
    -   Effect: Sever cough, especially after exertion. Loss of stamina.

        -   Raking Cough progresses: characters suffer -5 DUR / month.
            When characters reach their DUR, they die.

[]{#anchor-43}Using Magic
-------------------------

-   I've been moving this section around a lot. I've removed it before,
    when it was just talking about rituals, and then I added it back in
    the character guide. But, now that it's also talking about mages and
    psions, I've decided to put it back in the mechanical section.
-   In general, magical abilities that you have ready access to are best
    represented as either powers, classes or items (see Powers below,
    and in Character Options).
-   As above, powers represent some action that you can perform: this
    might be a sleight that increases your armor, a spell that allows
    you to shield yourself with ice, or a blessing bestowed on you by a
    spirit that allows you to strike fear into their enemies.
-   Classes can be used to represent magical effects that aren't
    actions. The Corpse-Herd class is an example of this: it represents
    the magical ability to build a corpse-minion that will serve you,
    but it's presented as a class rather than a power because presumably
    you'll only perform the action of making it occasionally (unless you
    get your corpse minion killed a lot).
-   Finally, items are useful to represent magical devices that you've
    created---like a bow that fires bolts of fire.

### []{#anchor-44}Creating Magical Effects

-   What else can your character do with magic? Presumably, if you're a
    skilled mage (i.e. if you have 40 or 50 ranks in Spellcraft), then
    surely you have other magical resources besides the powers that you
    have (or the ability to put on light shows, if you have the Mage
    class).
-   Indeed, skilled magic users, be they mages, psions or priests, can,
    with study and preparation, produce a wide variety of magical
    effects.

    -   These effects are usually "one-off" events; they usually requrie
        (at least) a task action of several hours to achieve, and an
        appropriate skill check (either spellcraft or control for mags
        and psions, the situations being somewhat more complicated for
        priests).
    -   We don't provide detailed rules for exactly what kinds of
        effects can be created. The intent is that characters should be
        able to specify any magical effect (within reason) and then
        realize that result as a one-off effect with appropriate
        preparation.
    -   The GM is the final arbiter for what is "within reason," of
        course. This might even change: such is the nature of magic,
        that what is possible at one time in one area might not be
        workable in another.

-   Mages

    -   Mages can produce a wide variety of useful effects. They usually
        do this by acquiring texts describing the manipulation of magic,
        researching and planning, preparing reagents and ultimately
        casting their spell.

        -   For power effects, this process might be long and
            involved---it could even be an adventure unto itself!
        -   Mechanically, this usually involves at least a spellcraft
            check to design the ritual, and another spellcraft check to
            perform it.
        -   knowledge: magic, profession: mage and research might all
            also be required, especially for complex, unusual or
            powerful rituals.

    -   With a few hours of study and preparation, a mage might produce
        a great fireball or freeze over the surface of a lake.
    -   With a few days of work, a mage might raise a shield over a
        house, or blight a field.
    -   With weeks or months of works, mages might render a tower nearly
        indestructible, unleash a plague on a city, or construct a
        permanent bridge of light.

-   Psions

    -   Psions can create powerful affects through meditation,
        concentration and mental discipline.

        -   Psions often achieve this with hours of meditation and
            mental conditioning; this usually requires a control check.

    -   With a few hours of preparation, a psion could suspend the
        progress of a disease, listen to the thoughts of someone nearby,
        render themselves immune to a hostile environment (as long as
        they can maintain their trance) or solve a complex logic puzzle.
    -   With a few days of meditation and quiet contemplation, a psion
        could render themselves nearly immune to damage (as long as they
        can sustain the trance), cast their mind far from their bodies,
        or heal their wounded psyches (regaining some stress and trauma
        much like the rules for first aide).
    -   With weeks or months of quiet contemplation and meditation,
        psions could make themselves younger, regrow limbs, modify their
        physical forms (growing a carapace, adding limbs), or probe the
        minds of distant enemies.

-   Priests

    -   Priests can strike deals with spirits. Spirits are powerful, but
        also mysterious and mercurial: this makes this form of magic
        both incredibly powerful, but also incredibly complex and
        dangerous.

        -   Bargaining with spirits is the *most powerful* form of magic
            available, especially if a suitably powerful spirit is
            contacted; however, it is also the most difficult and
            dangerous. See *Spirits* and the sections that follow it for
            more information.
        -   More than designing a spell or meditating, striking a
            bargain with a spirit is best handled "cinematically." A
            well-struck bargain can change the course of an adventure,
            but it's also an intense encounter with a very powerful and
            (possibly) very alien being, and no two such encounters are
            alike.
        -   Bargains with spirits are frequently local: different areas
            have different spirits, so any deal struck will depend on
            the spirits in an area that can be bargained with, and what
            abilities they have to offer. (Remember that spirits have a
            hierarchy: the spirits whose basin is a local glade might be
            relatively easy to bargain with, but also not very powerful;
            a spirit whose basin is an entire mountain might be
            extraordinarily powerful, but also almost impossible to bend
            to mortal wishes, or even to contact.)

    -   Dealing with a spirit generally uses the following procedure:

        -   Research Local Spirits

            -   if you aren't a priest in the area, you probably don't
                know how the local spirits operate; even if you are,
                checking the library for any "gotchase" is wise.
            -   Pay special attention to any binds that the spirits may
                have; messing up a bind with an uncooperative spirit
                might kill you!
            -   Normally an 8 hour Task Action, requiring a Research
                check, with Knowledge: Theology, Profession: Priest or
                similar as a related skill.

        -   Design the Ritual

            -   Normally a 4 hour Task Action, requiring a Profession:
                Priest or similar check.
            -   Knowledge: Theology is a related skill, and an
                Exceptional or Critical Success on your Research test
                may help.

        -   Perform the Ritual

            -   a one hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Priest
                or similar check.

        -   Bargain with the Spirit

            -   Once summoned---assuming it was summoned correctly---you
                can now bargain with the spirit. This is done
                in-character, using your social skills.
            -   Rituals don't have error messages; it's possible that
                things can go completely wrong in ways that might not be
                obvious.

[]{#anchor-45}Powers
--------------------

General rules for powers

-   Powers represent some interesting *ability* that a character has.
    They can represent magical powers, unique physical abilities,
    martial maneuvers, or other abilities.
-   Powers usually either

    -   represent an action (in which case they'll say what type of
        action they require to perform, and how to resolve them), or
    -   modify other powers.

-   Powers can be taken from the example list, but players can also
    develop their own. GMs must approve powers developed by players;
    this process usually takes the form of a conversation between the GM
    and the player, trying to achieve the effect that the player wants
    in a way that is reasonable and that works within the rules of the
    game.
-   Here are some good guidelines to follow for designing powers:

    -   Powers should usually be D10 based; this is a D% system, and
        players are likely to have D10s handy.
    -   Powers should either require ranks in a Skill, or be linked to
        some other power that requires ranks in a Skill, or both.
    -   In general, when a power adversely affects another character, an
        opposed check should be made. Usually only one check should be
        called for; more than one is unfair to the attacker, fewer than
        one is unfair to the defender.

        -   Note that the "opposed check" doesn't have to be the skill
            that the power is linked to. The "opposed check" for
            Fireball, for example, is the Thrown Weapon attack to hit a
            target with it.

    -   Since characters will get few powers (compared to D&D, for
        example), each power should be *versatile*. Clever players
        should be able to find a number of uses for their powers.
    -   Conversely, to keep things interesting and to give other
        characters a chance to contribute, each power should have
        situations where it clearly *does not* apply.
    -   Powers can build on one another; if you're having trouble
        building a power, it might help to split it into two powers in a
        sequence.
    -   Powers should not negate the need for a given skill; for
        example, a "tongues" power is a bad idea, because it sidesteps
        the 'languages system' and removes any incentive players might
        have to learn other languages.

        -   This is why fireball is treated as a normal held object, so
            the Thrown Weapons skill is required to make best us of it.
        -   it's also why we have Blur and not Invisibility; to use Blur
            effectively, you still need ranks in Stealth.

    -   Avoid Powers (especially maneuvers) that represent things that
        any expert should be able to do. Remember that a character with
        40 ranks in Bladed Weapons is a master swordsman; they shouldn't
        need to purchase any specific powers to do things that any
        skilled swordsman would be able to do.
    -   Avoid Powers that would be "mandatory" for any given character
        design. There shouldn't be a power that every social character
        needs to take to be functional, for example.
    -   A "full invisibility" power is a real bad idea.
    -   Also avoid D&D-style instant heals; healing is supposed to be
        difficult, and wounds sustained in combat are supposed to have a
        real impact (for the rest of the combat at least, and preferably
        into at least the next scene).

-   Some useful definitions:

    -   Spell: a power that requires ranks in the Spellcraft skill;
        assumed to draw power from ambient magical energies.
    -   Sleight: a power that requires ranks in the Control skill;
        assumed to draw power from personal magical energies.
    -   Maneuver: a power that requires ranks in a Combat skill; a
        combat maneuver achieved by great skill, without the aid of
        magic (unless it's also a spell, sleight or boon)
    -   Boon, Blessing: a power that has been granted by a Spirit,
        possibly drawing power from them or their Basin.

[]{#anchor-46}Luck
------------------

Characters (Player Characters and major NPCs) have a Luck stat, and a
certain numbr Luck Points. All characters acquire 1 Luck for free, and
characters can purchase more Luck during Character Creation. Luck
represents an extra edge, an extra bit of fortune and favor that
characters can use to make sure they get the job done despite the odds.

A player's Luck stat is the maximum number of luck points they may have
(and the number of Luck Points they start with); the number of luck
points they currently have will fluctuate over the course of a game.
Players may spend Luck Points to do the following:

-   After a check:

    -   "Flip" a check result (i.e. replace a 94 with a 49)
    -   Upgrade the result

-   Before a check:

    -   Ignore the negative modifiers to a test

Players have several ways to regain luck points:

-   Players regain 1 luck point at the start of a session
-   Players may be awarded 1 luck point for achieving a major success
    that contributes to one of their motivations
-   Players may be awarded 1 luck point for excellent roll-playing

Finally, players may loose luck points for:

-   A major failure relating to one of their motivational goals
-   Exceptionally poor roll-playing (only in extreme circumstances!)

Sidebar: How many Luck Points can you spend on a check?

-   As far as the rules go, there is no set limit: a player could spend
    a point of luck to remove all penalties, then spend a luck point to
    flip a test from an 81 to a 18 to pass the test, and then spend a
    luck point again to upgrade that to an exceptional success.
-   However, GMs who want to produce a tougher game for their
    players---or who don't want their players to dump Luck Points at the
    end of a game---may limit their use of luck, allowing only one point
    to be spent on a test (for example).

Thought: rename this* *back to Moxie, or something else more general,
and make it do more things. I already have a couple of abilities that
allow you to do stuff with Luck, and I like them; I have a couple more I
wanted to add, except that linking them to "Luck" doesn't make much
sense.

[]{#anchor-47}Size
------------------

Most characters will be roughly the same size as a human---that is, size
Medium. Some are larger, up to the size of a bear (size Large), while
others are smaller, roughly

[]{#anchor-48}Characters
------------------------

Characters have the following:

-   Aptitudes

    -   represents a character's fundamental mental abilities---how
        intelligent they are, how intuitive they are, etc.
    -   Each Aptitude has a *rating* between 5 and 40, representing your
        character's ability with that aptitude.
    -   Cognition (COG): your characters ability to analyze, reason and
        plan.
    -   Coordination (COO): your characters ability to manage their
        posture and balance, their ability to get their body into
        different configurations.
    -   Intuition (INT): your character's ability to pick up on
        patterns, to master "unwritten rules" and pick up on
        subconscious queues.
    -   Reflexes (REF): your character's ability to react quickly.
    -   Savvy (SAV): your character's ability to manage social
        situations.
    -   Somatics (SOM): your character's ability to manage your body.
    -   Willpower (WIL): your character's self-discipline.
    -   Sidebar: Somatics is a mental aptitude?

        -   Somatics (SOM) sounds like some kind of "mental strength
            score." How does that make sense?
        -   Partly, that's just to make the skill system work: some
            physical skills (like Unarmed Combat) need an attribute to
            be linked to---or else we'd need to build special cases for
            them into the rules. We inherited that from Eclipse Phase.
        -   However, that's also how the body *actually works*. The
            central nervous system has to learn to recruit and manage
            the muscles of the body, and some people really do learn to
            do this better than others!

-   A race, which gives you

    -   Health and Strength values,

        -   which represent that race's physical strength and
            durability.

        -   which represent faculties that the race is particularly good
            (or bad) at.

    -   Senses and movement modes
    -   A size

        -   playable races are usually size Medium, about human sized;
            they are sometimes Large or Small.

    -   special characteristics,

        -   which represent unique quirks or abilities that the race
            has---like a Gnoll's thick hide, or a Shifter's ability to
            change shape.

-   Ranks in skills

    -   representing the things your character has learned to do.

    -   represent where your character is from.
    -   provides you with ranks in skills, and sometimes other benefits.

-   Classes

    -   represent associations your characters has
    -   these either represent some organization that you can call on
        for aide, or they let you "break a rule" in an interesting way.

        be done with powers

-   Vital Statistics (which are derived from your other choices)

    -   Durability (DUR)

        -   determined by your race, possibly adjusted by effects,

[]{#anchor-49}Skills
====================

[]{#anchor-50}Skill List
------------------------

-   Academics (COG, Field Skill)

    -   Passive, Knowledge, Mental, Technical
    -   Academics represents formal training in a field of study.
        Players can use it to gain information about the world (which
        their characters might have even though they do not), or to
        evaluate clues.
    -   though it rankles my Fedora, knowledge of religion is covered by
        Academics (Academics: Theology)
    -   Sample Fields: Astronomy, History, Literature, Mathematics,
        Natural Philosophy, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Theology
    -   I feel like we might need Academics fields for Magic and
        Psyonics, esp. since I do want those things to be studied at
        Commonwealth universities. But I'm not completely sure what I
        should call them and I'm a little skeptical of adding more
        skills that caster-characters will feel like they need (esp.
        when Clerics only need Academics: Theology).
    -   Sample Specializations: as appropriate to field.

-   Animal Handling (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Animal Handling is used as the "Social Skill for Animals". It's
        used to coax animals into behaving how you want.
    -   Animal Handling can be used to train an animal, but we don't
        provide detailed rules for that. This is generally best handled
        either by purchasing a Class or Power (like Wildlander), or by
        purchasing the animal companion as a Moderate or Major Item and
        then building it using the rules for Followers.
    -   Sample Specialization: by a family of animals (canines, felines,
        equines, etc.), or by role (combat, work, companion, riding)

-   Art (INT, Field Skill)

    -   Active, Knowledge
    -   Sample Fields: Literature, Painting, Sculpture, Theater
    -   Specializations: by field

-   Athletics (SOM)

    -   Active, Movement, Physical
    -   Represents your characters' general athletic ability.
    -   Abstracts and combines several other movement skills (like
        climbing, swimming and parkour).
    -   Example Specializations: acrobatics, running, parkour, climbing,
        swimming
    -   For expertise in specific sports, see Sport.

-   Barter (SAV)

    -   Active, Social, Technical, Trade
    -   Your ability to acquire things you need (or want) at a good
        price; used in the rules for *Acquiring Items*.
    -   Barter is specifically used for trading, which normally means
        when acquiring goods (as in *Items*, below). Normally,
        negotiations (like legal bartering in a courtroom) are handled
        with Protocol (see below).
    -   It seems far more specific than these other skills, but it's
        useful because other mechanics us it. Still a little torn on
        this'n.

-   Bladed Weapons (SOM)

    -   Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
    -   Used for yer stabbin'

-   Blunt Weapons (SOM)

    -   Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
    -   Represents your skill with blunt weapons---bludgeons, clubs,
        maces and so on.
    -   Also used when attempting to shield bash someone.
    -   Example Specialization: by weapon

-   Control (WIL)

    -   Active, Mental
    -   Your ability to manipulate your own natural magical energy.
    -   Primarily used with sleights that require tests, or to develop
        new sleights.
    -   Example Specialization: by power

-   Craft (COG, Field Skill)

    -   Active, Physical, Technical, Trade
    -   Used to make things
    -   Sample Fields: Carpentry, Chemistry, Clockwork, Glassworking,
        Leatherworking, Masonry, Smithing

-   Deception (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Used to deceive people in social situations---to make other
        characters believe what you want them to believe.
    -   Can also be used (probably in conjunction with Disguise) to hide
        your identity, and possibly to impersonate someone else.
        (Obviously, impersonating a specific person will be very tricky,
        and might not be possible at all if you don't have information
        about that person to go on, or are forced to interact with
        people who know that person well.)
    -   For minor or simple lies, can be used unopposed.
    -   For big lies, important scenes or major characters, your
        Deception is opposed by either the target's Read or their Resist
        Social Manipulation.
    -   Example Specializations: lying, negotiating, impersonation

-   Disable Device (REF)

    -   Active, Physical, Technical
    -   Represents your ability to defeat mechanical devices.
    -   Used to pick locks, disable traps and disable magical devices.
    -   Usually used unopposed, although the quality of the device might
        impose a penalty (or allow a bonus).
    -   Specialization: lock-picking, traps, clockwork
    -   maybe should be COG or COO, but hey, not enough REF skills.

-   Disguise (INT)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Disguise is used to physically disguise yourself as someone
        else.
    -   You will often also need to have *Deception* in order to pass
        yourself off as someone else in a social situation.

-   Exotic Skill (Attribute Varies, Field Skill)

    -   Exotic, *other tags*
    -   Freeform skill, used to handle very unusual cases of other
        skills. Examples:
    -   Exotic Weapon (COO for ranged, SOM for melee)
    -   Exotic Culture (SAV, Protocol for very alien cultures)
    -   Exotic Knowledge (COG, for esoteric knowledge)
    -   Exotic Mount (REF or SAV)
    -   Exotic Movement (SOM or COO)
    -   Don't be too eager to resort to Exotic Skills! You are *almost
        always* better served by using a normal skill, perhaps with a
        specialization to indicate your unique background or interest.

-   Fray (REF)

    -   Active, Combat, Physical
    -   Your general-use defense skill, representing your ability to
        avoid attacks.
    -   Can also be used to test your ability to dodge and evade.

-   Fly (REF)

    -   Active, Movement, Physical
    -   Used to represent your character's skill at flying and areal
        maneuvering.
    -   There's no rule against a creature that can't fly taking ranks
        in the fly skill---although it also won't do them much good.

-   Interest (COG, Field Skill)

    -   Passive, Knowledge
    -   Represents knowledge in some area of interest for your
        character. Interest represents informal study; for formal
        training, consider either Academics or Profession.
    -   Almost anything can be an Interests, and Interests can be very
        broad or very specific.
    -   Example Fields: Criminal Gangs, Folklore, Local Religions, Noble
        Heraldry
    -   Some characters might substitute an Interest for an Academic
        skill, representing extensive experience with a body of
        knowledge they have attained outside of an academic institution.
        A shaman who has had no formal academic training might have
        Interest: Theology or Interest: Shamanic Rights, for example,
        and use those skills in place of Academics: Theology. You should
        discuss such a substitution with your GM.

-   Intimidate (SAV)

    -   Active, Combat, Social
    -   Used to represent your characters ability to manipulate others
        through menace rather than poise.
    -   Usually used opposed, against the target's *Resist Intimidation*
        (see *Special Numbers *below).
    -   Specialization: by circumstance (interrogation, combat) or by
        method (physical intimidation, blackmail)

-   Investigate (INT)

    -   Active, Technical
    -   Used to draw conclusions, assemble details.
    -   Search is used to find things (including evidence at a crime
        scene, for example). Investigate is used to draw conclusions
        from those clues.

-   Knowledge (COG, Field Skill)

    -   Passive, Knowledge, Mental, Technical
    -   Represents knowledge in some area of interest for your
        character.
    -   Almost anything can be a Knowledge field. When selecting a
        field, be careful: it shouldn't be so narrow that it never
        applies, but it also shouldn't be so broad that it *always*
        applies.
    -   Example Fields:

        -   by interest: Criminal Gangs, Folklore, Local Religions,
            Military Tactics, Noble Lines
        -   by academic study: Astronomy, History, Literature, Magic,
            Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Philosophy, Rhetoric,
            Theology

-   Language (INT, Field Skill)

    -   Passive, Knowledge, Mental
    -   Sample Fields: by language, e.g. Common, Hud, Royal

-   Medicine (COG)

    -   Active, Knowledge, Physical, Technical
    -   Can be used to diagnose and treat injuries.

-   Perception (INT)

    -   Active, Mental

-   Persuasion (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Used when attempting to convince a character to go along with
        something.
    -   For minor dealings with an NPC, usually used unopposed. For
        important tests, or when an NPC is skeptical or requires
        convincing, oppose with a Resist Social Manipulation check (see
        below).
    -   For social negotiations, use opposed Persuasion (or Protocol)
        checks.

-   Pointed Weapons (SOM)

    -   Active, Combat, Physical
    -   For putting spear in other man.

-   Pole-Arms (SOM)

    -   Active, Combat, Physical
    -   Skill used for pole-arms.
    -   Pole-arm classification "supersedes" other weapon
        classification---meaning that halberds and goedendags are
        pole-arms rather than bladed or blunt weapons.

-   Profession (COG, Field Skill)

    -   Passive, Technical, Trade
    -   Represents your knowledge and experience within a specific skill
        or trade.
    -   Used for checks testing your knowledge about a profession, or
        for your ability to operate as a professional for a long period
        of time.
    -   Can be used to represent you practice a trade for profit
        (particularly during down-time).

        interaction.
    -   Can be used to negotiate, for example in a legal debate or
        hostage negotiation.
    -   Can be used to *recover gracefully* after a roll-playing error
        (like saying something that your character would never say).
    -   Very exotic, unusual or secretive cultures use the Exotic
        Culture skill.
    -   Negotiating prices and trading uses the Barter skill.

-   Read (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   As in, Read Body Language; appraise others' motives in social
        situations.
    -   Used *unopposed* when used to assess someone's mood.
    -   Used to oppose Deception.

-   Research (COG)

    -   Primarily covers searching for information in books,
        collections, museums or libraries.

        -- use Search.
    -   For drawing conclusions and analyzing evidence, use
        Investigation.
    -   For drawing conclusions from technical information, use an
        appropriate Knowledge or Profession skill.

-   Ride (REF)

    -   Active, Movement, Physical
    -   Ride checks represent your skill at riding steeds (and possibly
        other conveyances, magical and mundane).
    -   A character with basic competence (that is, 10 ranks in ride)
        doesn't need to make a Ride check for normal movement with a
        mount: if you know how to ride a horse, you don't need to make a
        test to ride to town.
    -   Ride is a "movement skill," commonly used either for difficult
        maneuvers or for chases (see *Movement Modes*).
    -   Can specialize in an individual creature (like Horses) or an
        individual task (Racing).
    -   Very unusual creatures should use the Exotic Mount skill, see
        the Exotic Skill.

-   Search (INT)

    -   Active, Physical
    -   Used to find interesting, possibly-hidden items (including
        artifacts at a ruin, evidence at a crime scene, a secret door
        hidden in a library).
    -   Can also be used to search someone for concealed items (opposed
        by their Sleight of Hand if they have actually attempted to
        conceal something).
    -   Can also be used to track another creature (opposed by their
        Stealth if they're trying to avoid being followed).
    -   Search is used when you are going to move around an area and
        investigate over time. For "at a glance" tests, use Perception.

-   Sleight of Hand (COO)

    -   Active, Physical
    -   Used for pick-pocketing, hiding (or retrieving) objects on your
        person, misdirection and simple tricks and illusions.
    -   Can be opposed by the Perception of anyone watching you.
    -   Example Specializations: illusions, pick-pocketing.

-   Spellcraft (COG)

    -   Active, Physical, Mental, Technical
    -   Your ability to manipulate magic to create spells.
    -   Used to design, learn and cast spells.

        Knowledge: Magic, while skill as a professional spellcaster is
        represented by Profession: Mage.

        (conjuration, teleportation, etc.).

-   Sport (SOM, Field)

    -   Active, Physical
    -   Represents your skill in a specific sport.
    -   Example Fields: by specific sports

-   Survival (INT)

    -   Active, Physical
    -   Represents your ability so survive in the wilds, away from
        civilization.
    -   Can be used to build shelters, hunt, find food and water in the
        wild, identify hazardous natural features, know how to survive
        in hostile environments like deserts and tundras.
    -   Special: you can use Survival \[Urban\] to represent a
        character's ability to survive on the streets of a large city.
    -   Example Specializations: by terrain type (woodlands, jungles,
        deserts, tundras, etc.)

-   Stealth (COO)

    -   Active, Combat, Physical
    -   Represents your ability to go unnoticed.
    -   Used for sneaking about; if you're trying to sneak past an
        observer, used opposed by the guard's Perception.
    -   Can be used to blend in to a crowd, in which case it's usually
        used unopposed.
    -   If you are trying to follow someone without being noticed, then
        it is opposed by that person's Perception.
    -   Can be used to travel without leaving a trail.
    -   To avoid being seen, you normally need something to hide behind;
        it's hard to hide from someone if they can plainly see you.
    -   Some sense (like Scent or Mage Sight) might also render Stealth
        impractical.
    -   Sample Specializations: Sneaking, Blending In

-   Thrown Weapon (COO)

    -   Active, Attack, Combat, Physical, Ranged Attack
    -   Used to attack a target by throwing something at them.
    -   Used to throw explosives, daggers, darts and axes.

-   Unarmed (SOM)

    -   Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
    -   Used to represent your skill at hand-to-hand combat.
    -   Covers natural weapons too (like claws and fangs).

Sidebar: Unusual Skills

-   Sometimes you'll want your character to be able to do something that
    isn't exactly covered by a skill---like tracking game through the
    woods.
-   While players can use an Exotic Skill to take ranks in an unusual
    skill, they are usually better served by taking an existing skill
    with a descriptive specialization. For example, players would almost
    always be better off taking Search \[Tracking\] than taking Exotic
    Skill: Tracking.
-   The Knowledge and Profession skills can also be used to establish a
    specific special skill-set for a character---for example,
    Profession: Hunter or Interest: Tracking.
-   In addition to thinking about how you want to represent your
    character's talents, think about how you want to be able to *use*
    the skill during a game.
-   If you're unsure about a skill selection, you should discuss it with
    the GM; make sure that the GM understands not only what you want the
    skill to represent, but what you want to be able to *do* with it,
    and be sure that you and the GM agree with not only what the skill
    is supposed to represent, but what it's supposed to do and how it's
    supposed to work.

Sidebar: Gotchas and Confusing Cases

-   Disguise only covers the *physical* half of pretending to be someone
    else; for the social half---that is, to talk to people without being
    discovered---you'll also need Deception.
-   Search is used to actively search an area for something; it takes
    time, and you move around. Perception is usually used for noticing
    things quickly---seeing things when you enter a room, as opposed to
    after looking around. Search is also used to track someone or
    something.
-   Control is used to manage your own magical energies, and to develop
    sleights; it should not be used to represent a characters "will
    power," that's the WIL attribute.
-   Investigate is primarily a mental action: it can be used to solve a
    mystery, given clues that have already be found. To actually find
    clues (at a crime scene, for example), use Search.
-   Normally, solving a crime would be treated as Solving a Logic Puzzle
    (requiring a COG × 3 check, as below). If you would like to build a
    detective character, consider using Profession: Detective or
    Profession: Investigator to represent your character's ability to
    solve mysteries.

[]{#anchor-51}Special Numbers:
------------------------------

Sometimes no skill applies: in these cases, use combinations of
Aptitudes. Some common examples follow:

-   Resist Intimidation / Overcome Fear: WIL × 2
-   Resist Social Manipulation: SAV + INT
-   Recall Personal Experience: COG × 3
-   Take a Chance, Get Lucky: Luck × 10

    -   Note, that's the Luck stat, not your current Luck Points

-   Make A Guess (or Get a Hint): INT × 3
-   Solve a Logic Puzzle: COG × 3
-   Feat of Strength (bend bars, break down a door): SOM + STR
-   Feat of Endurance (endure a long march, resist disease, survive
    starvation): DUR + WIL
-   React Quickly: REF × 3
-   Catch Something: COO + REF + REF

[]{#anchor-52}Character Creation and Advancement
================================================

[]{#anchor-53}Character Creation
--------------------------------

Proceed through the following steps in order:

-   For Free:

    -   60 ranks in your native language (pick an appropriate one)
    -   10 ranks in Language: Common (Commonwealth Standard)
    -   1 Luck

-   Choose Aptitudes

    -   Characters start with a rating of 15 in each Aptitude
    -   add to one Aptitude by subtracting equally from another.

-   Pick your race, which will include:

    -   Aptitude Bonuses
    -   Health (DUR), Strength (STR) and Size
    -   senses and movement
    -   other special properties

-   15 tweak points

    -   add 1 to an Aptitude
    -   add 1 to your Durability
    -   add 1 to your Strength

-   Pick your Background

    -   The bonuses granted by your Background "apply" now. In
        particular, that means that, if your background grants you skill
        ranks, then those are your "first" ranks in that skill -- you
        will have them before you start spending CP.
    -   Skill Ranks granted by your background work exactly like ranks
        that you paid fore.
    -   So, if your background gives you 10 ranks in Barter, you can buy
        20 more ranks for 20 CP (1 a piece), and then 20 more ranks for
        40 CP (2 CP a piece), and be at the maximum of 50 ranks during
        Character Creation.

-   800 Creation Points

    -   1 CP → 1 point in a skill (30 or fewer skill points purchased)
    -   2 CP → 1 skill point (31^st^ skill point, and there-after)
    -   10 CP → a trait
    -   10 CP → a class
    -   10 CP → a power
    -   15 CP → +1 Luck
    -   5 CP → A specialization

        -   you must have 10 ranks in the skill, see *Skills*

    -   Items:

        -   1 CP → minor (simple) item
        -   5 CP → normal (useful) item
        -   10 CP → major (magical) item
        -   see *Items*

-   Motivations

    -   Ideally, three one-word descriptions, with a + ("support" or
        "pro") or a - ("against")
    -   For Example: +Wealth +Freedom -Shade Elves
    -   Motivations are abstract, long-term goals; they're the causes
        your character is dedicated too. They shouldn't be short term,
        and most of the really good ones can't even be completely
        achieved at all!

-   Character Creation Limits

    -   no more than 50 ranks in a skill
    -   no aptitudes higher than 35 (including racial bonus and tweak
        points) or lower than 5
    -   at least 200 CP spent on skills with the *combat *tag
    -   at least 200 CP spent on skills that don\'t have the *combat
        *tag

-   Global Limits

[]{#anchor-54}Character Advancement
-----------------------------------

As characters operate in the world (and especially as they complete
adventures), they will gain Rez Points (RP); RP rewards are the primary
method by which characters advance, and are the primary reward for most
adventures. Characters can spend rez to advance during down-time, using
the same rules by which they spent CP during character creation. When
spending rez, the character-creation limits no longer apply, although
the glocal limits still do.

We don\'t have rules for training requirements, but gaining new skills
should generally make sense. Skills and classes can be justified either
by events during the adventure, or effort undertaken during down-time.
You usually cannot gain new Backgrounds, and there are some Traits that
you cannot buy with Rez (at the GM's discretion).

See also the "Buying Off Negative Traits" optional rule.

[]{#anchor-55}NPCs and Followers
--------------------------------

NPCs and Followers use slightly different rules. As opposed to Player
Characters (those characters that are controlled by the Players),
Non-Player Characters are controlled by the GM and used to populate the
world. Most NPCs will not have complete statistics; most NPCs will only
have stats appropriate to their roll, such as a shop-keeper only having
a Barter skill, a Protocol skill and a certain number of Trade Goods.
"Major NPCs" are those that are prominent in a campaign -- a friendly
noble who gives the players their mission, for example, or the
arch-villain of the campaign. Finally, Followers are "friendly"
characters associated with a player, such as an assistant or helper. It
is generally advised that players be allowed to control their Followers,
although the GM may prevent a Player from having a Follower do something
completely unreasonable (like mortally wounding themselves, or giving
the Player Character all their material wealth.)

Major NPCs, NPCs and Followers use the standard Character Creation
rules, except for the following:

-   Major NPCs receive 1 Luck for free like PCs, but cannot purchase
    additional Luck.
-   Minor NPCs do not receive Luck, cannot purchase Luck, and start with
    only 10 in each Aptitude.
-   Followers do not receive Luck, cannot purchase Luck, and receive a
    lower number of Creation Points. The feature that is granting a
    Follower will specify how many Creation Points they receive, and
    might specify other limits as well.

[]{#anchor-56}Senses, Movements and Special Abilities
=====================================================

The following are common Senses, Movement types and Special Abilities.
This list is by no means exhaustive.

[]{#anchor-57}Senses
--------------------

-   Normal: the normal senses that humans have
-   Blind-Sight: you have the ability to sense your surroundings, even
    when you cannot see; this might be a result of the heightening of
    your other sense, it might be a mechanism like a bat's sonar, or it
    might be a supernatural ability. Even in conditions of total
    darkness, you can perceive your environment, including any object
    larger than a human fist, out to a distance of 30m. You cannot
    perceive color or fine detail. Perception tests made with
    Blind-Sight suffer a -20 penalty.

    -   This is more like D&D Dark-Vision than I wanted it to be; I did
        not want to add off-brand Dark Vision.

-   Infra-red: you can see in infra-red. This is particularly useful at
    night.
-   Low-Light: creature can see clearly in low-light conditions (but not
    total darkness).
-   Mage-Sight: you can perceive magical energy. You can see active
    magical effects, and you can attempt to determine what a magical
    effect is by studying it (a 10 minute task action, requiring an
    appropriate Knowledge check).
-   Scent: you have an extremely keen sense of smell. This allows you to
    detect many sneaking creatures, and to identify things by smell.
-   Tremor-sense: when in contact with a solid object, you can sense
    vibrations propagating through it. This allows you to sens
    approaching footfalls through the ground, for example.

[]{#anchor-58}Movement Modes
----------------------------

General Rules:

-   Creatures have several different movement modes.
-   Most movement modes list *walking* and *running* rates

    -   see *Combat* for rules about movement rates in combat.

-   Some movement modes also list a *maximum speed*, which is the
    maximum speed allowed for that movement mode.

    -   We don't have detailed rules for acceleration; as a rough guide,
        for movement modes with a maximum speed, you can add either your
        Walking or Running rate to your current speed in any given turn.

-   Most movement modes have a *linked skill*, which is used for tests
    regarding that movement mode. Tests are usually called for when
    difficult maneuvers are made (such as running across a slick
    surface), when attempting to *sprint* (see *Combat*) or as opposed
    tests during *chase scenes*.

    -   Most movement modes, including Walking movement, use the
        Athletics skill.
    -   Flying movement use the Flying skill.
    -   Mounted movement uses the Riding skill.
    -   Other movements mode, such as Burrowing movement, use the Exotic
        Movement skill.

Movement Modes:

-   Burrowing: you can burrow through the ground. You can choose to
    leave a tunnel behind you or not. Some soil, such as hard or rocky
    soil, cannot be burrowed through. If you have Burrowing as a
    movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while burrowing.

    -   Linked to Exotic Movement: Burrowing

-   Climbing: you can climb as easily as humans can walk. Note that some
    creatures can't climb some surfaces (someone that climbs with claws,
    like a cat, cannot climb on glass or metal, for example).

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

-   Flying: you can fly.

    -   Linked to the Flying skill.

-   Leaping: you move in a series of hops, like a kangaroo or frog.

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.
    -   Less hindered by broken group or small gaps

-   Swimming: you can swim as easily as humans can walk. If you have a
    Swim movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while underwater
    (presuming you need to breathe).

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

-   Walking: bipedal movement.

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

[]{#anchor-59}Abilities
-----------------------

-   Fast Healing: when you have Fast Healing *k*, you reduce your Damage
    by *k* each turn -- normally healing by 20 \* *k* a minute. Every
    day, you may recover from one wound (what it might look like
    half-way through this process is best not thought about).
-   Motion-Sensitive: your senses are particularly sensitive to motion.
    You receive a +10 bonus to Perception checks made against moving
    targets.

[]{#anchor-60}Sizes
-------------------

-   The affects of being a different size are generally not represented
    mechanically (i.e. there is no "size modifier table").
-   Being *small *or *large* might confer bonuses in some situations,
    such as making it easier (if small) or harder (if large) to use
    Stealth; these are at the GM's discretion.
-   See also *Sizes* in Combat.

[]{#anchor-61}Character Options
===============================

[]{#anchor-62}Races
-------------------

There are three separate keywords that have special significance in Race
entries. All races will have one of the following keywords: Natural,
Supernatural or Spirit. This tells you whether the race is
flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality
(Supernatural), or is composed entirely of magical energy (Spirit).

Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds. You
don't acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of
options at character creation, and you may *optionally* select them
using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or
Backgrounds during character creation. (So, for example, Shifters don\'t
*just have *the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during
character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible
for.)

Game Design Note: narrowing the stuff you get in Races down to *only*
what every member of that species would have, regardless of background.
Moving other features (c.f. skill bonuses) to backgrounds. Adding
Optional Backgrounds to races that have unique sub-cultures (like Ash
Elves, Herders or Dwarves).

Game Design Note: races selection should be interesting, and should
affect how you play the character. However, you shouldn't have to pick a
specific race to get a specific feature or be good at a specific job.
This is why many abilities were moved to Backgrounds, and why many
abilities are being replaced by Traits-for-free (so that any other Race
can just take the Trait if they want to).

[]{#anchor-63}Common Races
--------------------------

### []{#anchor-64}Ash Elves

-   The first Ash Elves where the descendants of Shade Elves captured in
    the siege of Islandholme, who then interbred with Wood Elves.

    -   Their communities have also absorbed Shade Elves fleeing the
        Shaded Sea, and Wood Elves looking seeking an urban life.

-   They remain very aware of their history. Most can tell the story of
    how their ancestors came to the Commonwealth---of the ancestor who
    was captured after the siege of Islandholme and had to integrate
    into a strange, new culture, or of fleeing some change in Shade
    Elven lands to take shelter in the Commonwealth.

    -   Many of them are also aware of the horrors present in the Shaded
        Sea today.

-   The Ash Elves have formed a deeply philosophical culture; in their
    past, they were avid students of the law, political writing and
    philosophy of other cultures, and in their present, they have become
    major producers of law and philosophy.

    -   They are a very mindful culture in particular, and the practice
        of meditation is common.
    -   They have formed a highly egalitarian and open culture, and
        today are maor advocates for greater Commonwealth unity and it's
        continued benevolent development.
    -   Because of this, members of other races often view Ash Elves as
        natural judges, and defer to their judgment in conflict.
    -   This can be for better or worse: most Ash Elves quickly consume
        a wide variety of literature, making them well but eclectically
        read; because of this, their personal philosophies can vary
        widely.

-   Ash Elves tend to prefer urban settlements, and Ash Elven can be
    found throughout the Commonwealth's major cities.

    -   They have also build their own cities and towns, most located
        either in the Haven Isles or on the Western shores of the
        Emerald Plane.
    -   They tend to build large communities underground, somewhat like
        Dwarves and Kobolds.
    -   They tend to be very open towards outsiders; they are widely
        known for joyous public celebrations that mark major holidays,
        in which they welcome outsiders, travelers and members of
        neighboring communities.

-   They are known for the quality of their artistry; their buildings,
    homes and settlements will often feature prominent art-pieces.
-   Ash Elves look much like humans, except for their fine features,
    their elegant and pointed ears, and their ash-grey skin.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 250 years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   DUR 25, STR 25
-   +5 REF +10 WIL +5 INT
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Elf, Ash Elf
-   Language Group: HHED
-   *Stoic*: Ash Elves can negate one Trauma
-   *Keen Senses*: Ash Elves receive +20 to visual Perception checks,
    and +10 to auditory perception checks.

-   Optional Trait: Meditation.

    -   Most Ash Elves study meditation all their lives, and can
        maintain their discipline in the direst of circumstances. When
        making a Control check, the Ash Elf ignores penalties from
        Wounds, Traumas and Distractions.

-   Optional Background: Ash-Elf Traditional

    -   10 ranks in the Control skill
    -   10 ranks in one Art skill and one Technical skill of your choice
    -   You gain the Meditation optional trait (you do not have to
        purchase it separately if you choose this back-ground)

### []{#anchor-65}Drakes

-   Descendants of Dragons interbreeding with Humans in the territories
    of the former Empire that were claimed by the red dragon Karrack

    -   NB: I don\'t want "humans can interbreed with everything else"
        to be a thing; presumably, this worked with Dragons because
        Dragons are already shape-shifters.

-   In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
    territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
    to take positions of authority, above Humans but below pure-blooded
    Dragons.
-   As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
    Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
    province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
    (of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.
-   Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of "noble blood",
    and many of them still hold hereditary titles -- which may or may
    not be of practical significance.
-   Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
    councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
    positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.
-   Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
    Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
    neighboring state.
-   Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
    draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire
-   Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
    immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
    comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean "blacksmithing" more
    often than it means "farm work".
-   Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
    proud and stubborn at worst.
-   Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
    head, long tail, powerfil limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
    Dragons. So maybe it's better to say they look like Dragons, except
    for being roughly humanoid in shape.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 100 Years
    -   Average Height: 2.4m
    -   Average Weight: 110kg

-   The descendants of Dragons and Humanoids, forming the hereditary
    upper-class of the Dragonshire.
-   DUR 40, STR 40
-   +5 SAV, +5 SOM, +10 WIL
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Dragon-Kin, Drake
-   Language Group: DDK, HHED
-   Scales: +2 Armor

-   Optional Trait: Chroma

    -   Though Drakes come in vibrant colors and hues, most have no
        inherited the particular magical natures of Dragons; you,
        however, have.
    -   You gain resistance to one of the following: Chemical, Cold,
        Disease, Electricity or Fire.

-   Optional Trait: Dragon's Flight

    -   Dragons have a wide variety of modes of motion, and you have
        inherited one of them.
    -   You gain one of the following movement modes: Swim 3 / 15,
        Burrow 2 / 6, Fly 3 / 15 / 45

-   Optional Power: Breath Weapon

    -   You have inherited the ability to breathe fire---or some other
        dangerous substance.
    -   This power has a Type. If you took the Chroma trait, then its
        type is the one you chose for your resistance; otherwise, the
        type is Fire.
    -   You gain one of the following effects, depending on the power's
        type:

        -   Chemical: you can spit a toxic spray. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, Splash 1D10 ÷ 3 m. Range 10m
            short / 20m long. Tags: Natural, Chemical. Covered opponents
            suffer 1D10 ÷ 2 DV a turn; the chemical can be washed off
            with water (a standard action requiring a source of water).
        -   Cold: you can hurl an icy spear. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -4. Tags:
            Natural, Cold, Ice
        -   Disease: You can launch a small bundle of bone-like spines
            infected with a deadly plague. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10 ÷ 2 DV, AP -3; Tags:
            Natural, Disease. If you deal DV, then your target is
            exposed to the disease. Build disease rules and come back.
        -   Electricity: you can deliver powerful electric shocks. Your
            unarmed attacks (and natural weapons, should you have any)
            deal an additional 1D10 damage and gain the Electric tag.
        -   Fire: you can breath fire. You gain the following attack:
            Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10+DB DV, AP -, Blast. Tags:
            Natural, Fire.

-   Optional Background: Dragonshire Noble

    -   You hail from a noble bloodline in the Dragonshire. Though
        actual rule now rests in the hands of the House of Commons,
        having the right ancestors* *is still *useful*.
    -   10 ranks in Protocol, 10 ranks on one other Social skill, 10
        ranks in one Combat skill
    -   Either the Noble Class or the Officer Class. If you select the
        Officer Class, you must later purchase the Soldier class during
        character creation, to meet its prerequisites.

### []{#anchor-66}Gnolls

-   Almost as social as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength
    (and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.
-   Gnolls are very common in small farming communities everywhere, and
    in the mid-sized manors throughout Heartland Province.
-   Gnolls make up more than half of the Commonwealth Military, where
    their strength is invaluable.
-   A small number of Gnollish tribal communities still exist.
-   Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than some other races do; because
    of this, Gnollish females have long served in military and
    leadership rolls.
-   Gnolls "cultural memory" still very much includes the legend of
    fleeing persecution from other savage Gnolls and settling beside
    humans; to this day, Gnolls are immensely proud of their roll in
    founding the Commonwealth, and the roll they continue to play in its
    prosperity and safety.
-   Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of
    other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races
    feel comfortable around them. Many Gnollish communities have two
    separate set of customs, one for "when other races are around," and
    one for when they\'re not. They are not secretive about this; they
    do this because, for example, they are evolved from carrion-eaters
    and most other races don\'t want to see Gnoll "cooking."
-   Gnolls are aware of how savage they look, and many put quite a lot
    of effort into developing elaborate, refined personal styles to
    counter this effect.
-   Gnolls are roughly humanoid, save their great size---and that they
    have the head and feat of a hyena, and are covered in dusky or ochre
    fur.
-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 50 Years
    -   Average Height: 2.2m
    -   Average Weight: 80kg

-   One of three Founding Races. Strong and tough, Gnolls are a majority
    of the military and are common on farming manors.
-   DUR 35, STR 35
-   +5 INT, +5 SAV, +10 SOM
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light, Scent
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Gnoll
-   Language Group: GR
-   *Hide*: +1 Armor
-   *Scavenger*: Resistance to food-borne illness (+20 on related
    checks)
-   *Sturdy*: Gnolls can Negate one Wound

-   Optional Background: Military Family

    -   You hail from one of the many Gnollish military families.
    -   +10 ranks in Fray
    -   +10 ranks in two other Combat skills
    -   the Soldier class

-   Optional Background: Caravan Guard

    -   Continuing a way of life that stretches back more than 700
        years, you travel with Halfling trade-caravans, serving as a
        guard, a bouncer, a hand and a diplomat.
    -   +10 ranks in Intimidate, Perception, Persuasion and Survival

### []{#anchor-67}Human

-   Social, dextrous and intelligent, Humans where the first race to
    build cities, and the first to build great nations.
-   Even today, Humans are widely renowned for their manual dexterity,
    for their society-building social instincts and their
    problem-solving abilities.
-   One of the three founding races (besides Gnolls and Halflings),
    Humans are widely regarded as the "social problem-solvers" who
    helped bind together all the widely different communities that came
    together to form the early Commonwealth.
-   Humans are frequently academics, professionals, scholars, lawyers
    and politicians.
-   Humans are common in the small towns of Heartland and Dragonshire,
    and are common in cities everywhere. And, of course, are the
    principle race of the Kingdoms of Man.
-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 60 years
    -   Average Height: 1.7m
    -   Average Weight: 60kg

-   One of the three Founding Races. Intelligent, dextrous and social,
    humans are the engineers of the Commonwealth -- building everything
    from wagons to societies.
-   DUR 30, STR 30
-   +5 COG, +5 COO, +10 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Human
-   Language Group: HHED
-   Social Animals:

    -   Humans reduce penalties to Social skills by 10.

        -   No, that's just boring, and it's kind of weird because it
            requires special-casing that a flat +10 to Social skill
            tests wouldn't have (although the latter would also be way
            too powerful on its own).

    -   After making a Social skill test, a Human may spend one Luck
        Point to re-roll it; they must take the second result, even if
        it's worse.

        -   I like one powerful, discrete ability more than nudging
            checks by 10, but is introducing re-rolls opening a can of
            worms?

    -   Humans gain the Social Animal trait.

        -   You know, I might not actually like this any better than the
            thing it's replacing.

### []{#anchor-68}Kobold

-   Kobolds are a relatively new addition to the Commonwealth; most
    Kobold communities trace their origins to a mass exodus from the
    Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.
-   Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.
-   Kobold culture is very family-oriented, and very community-oriented
-   Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
    families will cluster together to form a block.
-   Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
    public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
    their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
    and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.
-   Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
    families; because of this, they have grown explosively

    -   even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
        largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
        metropolises.

-   They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
    long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
    uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
    generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
    generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away -- an
    arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
    involved.
-   Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
    tend to be highly productive.
-   They look like tiny, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
    scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
    however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
    question.

    -   Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
        warm-blooded.
    -   Kobolds aren't mammals; they don't have mammary glands, and they
        have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
        different ideas about what constitutes "appropriate attire".

-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 40 Years
    -   Average Height: 1m
    -   Average Weight: 25kg

-   Clever, quick, industrious and sociable, Kobolds make up the
    majority of the underground cities.
-   DUR 25, STR 20
-   +5 INT, +10 REF, +5 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Infrared
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Dragon-Kin, Kobold
-   Language Group: DDK
-   *Scales*: Kobolds have +1 Armor
-   *Small*: Kobolds are small

-   Optional Trait: Chroma

    -   Though the blood of Dragons is thin in Kobolds, it does
        sometimes manifest itself.
    -   You gain resistance to one of the following: Chemical, Cold,
        Disease, Electricity or Fire.

-   Optional Trait: Dragon's Bite

    -   Though you don't possess a Dragon's breath, you have inherited
        (some of) their natural weapons, and they can be infused with a
        Dragon's fire---or some other elemental type.
    -   Your Dragon's Bite has a certain type. If you have the Chroma
        trait, then your type is the type you chose for Chroma; if you
        don't, your type is Fire.
    -   You gain the following attacks:

    -   You gain an additional effect, based on your *Type*:

        -   Chemical: Your claws and bite are toxic. Any creature you
            hit with either attack is *covered*, and thereafter takes 2

        -   Fire: your claws or bite are incredibly hot: your attack
            does +3 DB, and you can set flammable objects on fire.

### []{#anchor-69}Shifters

-   Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
    rare elsewhere.
-   Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
    Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
    practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
    communities.
-   Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
    goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
    other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
    other races.
-   Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
    wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
    always have, and be left alone.
-   Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
    seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
    offer.
-   While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
    Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
    find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
    town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
    the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
    they settle in.

    -   Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
        not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
        species.

-   Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
    among the communities that they settle in; "their own inclination"
    is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.
-   Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
    humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate
    to their hybrid form.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 90 Years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   Half elf, half human, half wild. Lycanthropes that can shift between
    humanoid and hybrid forms.
-   DUR 30, STR 30
-   +5 COO, +5 INT, +5 REF
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light
-   Supernatural, Humanoid, Human, Elf, Shape-Shifter, Shifter
-   Language Group: HHED (humanoid form); GR (hybrid form)
-   *Hybrid*: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid. The specific
    details of each form are fixed (that is, your Humanoid form (for
    example) looks the same every time you shift to it; you can\'t
    determine what your shape-shift forms look like each time you
    shift). You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a
    Standard Action.

    -   In Humanoid form, you have a mixture of Human and (Wood) Elvish
        features.
    -   In Hybrid from, you are roughly humanoid, but with the features
        of an animal.
    -   When you create your character, choose two of the following
        benefits. You gain the chosen benefits while in Hybrid form.

        -   Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.
        -   Teeth: You have a predator's jaw, which allows you to bite
            foes. The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP. When you bite
            someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose
            to *latch on*; this normally works like grappling the
            target.
        -   Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on appropriate
            Perception checks.
        -   Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in
            addition to your other movement modes): Burrow 1 / 3, Climb
            3 / 9, Flight 3 / 9 / 36, Glide 4 / 12 / 48, Hop 4 / 12,
            Swim 3 / 9
        -   Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent
            sense.
        -   Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you
            gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this
            environment. For example, you might choose to survive in
            extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.
        -   Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to
            motion. You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving
            targets.
        -   Sprinter: choose one movement mode; increase that mode's
            running speed by that mode's base speed. For example,
            Walking 4/12 could be increased to Walking 4/16.

-   *Fast-Healing*: you have Fast Healing 1

-   Optional Trait: Animal Form.

    -   If you purchase this trait, you gain an Animal form as well.
        Your animal form resembles a normal member of your Animal type.
        Your animal form can't be too large (as large as an elephant,
        larger than size Large) or too small (as small as a cricket,
        smaller than size Small).

[]{#anchor-70}Uncommon races
----------------------------

### []{#anchor-71}Clay Men

-   ancient, amorphous race. No internal organs or specialized tissues.
    Cannot make precise shapes. Have a texture and appearance somewhat
    like a giant mass of clay. (Can produce a wide variety of sounds,
    including speech, with surface vibrations.)
-   DUR 35, STR 20
-   +5 SAV, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Burrow 3 / 9, Surface 3 / 9, Swim 4 / 12
-   Senses: Infra-Red, Mage Sight, Tremor Sense
-   Tags: Supernatural, Shape-Shifter, Amorphous, Clay Men
-   Language Groups: CM
-   *Amorphous*: Clay Men are amorphous, and can manipulate their shape
    at will; they can stretch, narrow, ball up, flatten out, and so on.
    They cannot produce fine features, or alter their texture or color
    (other than to grip, as in *Pseudopods* below), and thus they cannot
    mimic specific people or objects. However, they can slip through
    small spaces, and they can be almost impossible to grapple or
    restrain effectively.
-   *No Vital Organs*: Clay Men do not have vital organs, and thus they
    are not vulnerable to attacks or powers that rely on targeting weak
    points or vital organs.

    -   They have Resistance to attacks with the Precision tag.

-   *No Face*: Clay Men have no particular "front" or facing, and they
    have no discrete sensory organs -- so they can perceive all around
    themselves, including directly above and below themselves.
-   *Pseudopods*: Clay Men can extend pseudopods. They can extend up to
    four pseudopods, each up to a meter long. They can manifest one
    fewer pseudopod to make on other pseudopod one meter longer (so they
    could, for example, extrude one four-meter pseudopod, or two
    two-meter pseudopods).
-   *No Bones*: Lacking a skeletal structure, Clay Men cannot take
    advantage of leverage; this severely reduces their ability to deploy
    their strength. Their damage bonus when using melee weapons is 0.
    This ability may have other consequences as well.
-   Envelop: Clay Men have a unique form of physical combat available to
    them: simply enveloping (and then digesting) an enemy. Enveloping
    works much like Grappling, except that a successfully enveloped
    enemy takes 1d10÷2 DV per turn while enveloped (this damage has the
    Chemical tag). Enveloped targets are normally held immobile, but, if
    they succeed on a STR+SOM check, they can deal damage to the Clay
    Man with any weapon they are holding (or any natural weapon).
-   *Fast Healing*: Clay Men have Fast Healing 1
-   *Powered*: Clay Men have internal supernatural process that help to
    keep them going. They need to breath (by exchanging oxygen through
    their surface), but they can extract oxygen from water as well as
    breathing air. They need to eat to grow, but they need little food
    when not growing or repairing damage. They do not need to sleep.
    They can be effected by disease, but are resistant to most diseases
    that affect humanoids (they have Resistance to diseases). They do
    not age.

-   Optional Trait: Color-Changing.

    -   You can change the color of your "skin". You can create shapes
        down to the scale of a few centimeters, which allows you to
        create large letters, or to camouflage yourself (providing you a
        +20 to Stealth).

-   Optional Trait: Rigging.

    -   You can produce an internal support structure made of cartilage.
        You can produce and dissolve the "rigging" at will: creating it
        is a Task Action with a six hour duration, and dissolving it is
        Task Action with a three hour duration. The rigging allows you
        to take advantage of internal leverage, and thus negates the No
        Bones trait; it also increases your STR by 5. However, the
        cartilage is fragile, and it exposes you to bits of tiny broken
        cartilage tumbling through you when you are injured; it reduces
        your DUR by 5.

### []{#anchor-72}Dwarves

-   A large nation of Dwarves exists, but, while affable enough, most of
    them prefer to deal with their own kind -- and their own kin at
    that. Still, a few Dwarf Holds, complete with their surrounding
    territories, signed the New Charter -- and were reorganized into
    Northland Province when the Compact came into effect.
-   DUR 35, STR 30
-   +10 SOM, +10 WIL
-   Movement: foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Infrared
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Dwarf
-   Language Group: HHED
-   *Squat*: Dwarves are treated as small targets when defending against
    ranged attacks (even though they are Medium-sized creatures)

-   Optional Background: Dwarven Hold

    -   +10 ranks in any two Craft or Profession skills
    -   +10 ranks in Protocol and Barter

### []{#anchor-73}Gnomes

-   Gnomes live in burrows in the lower ranges of the World Spine
    Mountains.
-   Gnome burrows reside near the surface; they are "burried shallow,"
    with surface entrances.
-   Gnome communities tend to be small; a dozen families or fewer,
    spread across as many burrows.
-   Gnomish communities tend to be isolated; they are not eager to
    receive guests, not even other Gnomes.
-   The outsiders they deal most frequently with are Kobolds, from
    burrows dug deeper underground in the World Spine Mountains.
-   Gnome communities tend to be *idiosyncratic*, owing to their limited
    outside contact.
-   Gnomish culture can blend the hedonic and the materialistic in
    strange ways. Because their communities are small and isolated, they
    are used to suffering hardship and want; however, they are also
    highly pleasure-seeking in their own way, and tend to be highly
    libertine and indulgent in the pursuit of mortal pleasure (when they
    have the opportunity).
-   As a result, they may appear to be humble, simple and rustic---until
    evening descends, when the party drugs come out.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 130 Years
    -   Average Height: 80cm
    -   Average Weight: 18kg

-   DUR 25, ST 20
-   +5 INT, +5 REF, +10 WIL
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Gnome
-   Language Group: HHED
-   Size: Gnomes are Small
-   Alchemically Attuned: Gnomes double the duration of drugs, and
    Gnomes receive a +10 bonus to checks to resist the effects of drugs.

-   Optional Background: Gnomish Burrow

    -   +10 ranks in Craft Alchemy, +10 ranks in one other Technical
        Skill, +10 ranks in Stealth
    -   One skill kit
    -   Isolationist: You do not receive 10 ranks in Common. Instead,
        you receive 10 ranks in World-Spine Kobold (group DDK).

### []{#anchor-74}Halflings

-   Halflings were one of the founding races of the Commonwealth.
-   Halflings have a somewhat unique dimorphic society; the young and
    hardy travel in Caravans, trading wares and selling their skills,
    while children, the infirm and the elderly live in fixed
    settlements.
-   Halfling communities tend to form close, symbiotic relationships
    with Gnollish villages and families. Halfling communities are
    frequently built near Gnollish towns and villages; they depend on
    the Gnolls for security and labor, and the Gnolls depend on the
    Halfling caravans to sell their produce.
-   In particular, Gnolls commonly travel with Halfling caravans,
    providing security---and services like smithing, for which Halflings
    are poorly suited.
-   Caravans of Halfling traders and Gnollish guards knitted together
    the early Commonwealth, and remain on of its most iconic
    elements---if distant kindgoms know nothing else about the
    Commonwealth, they know about the trade caravans, and might have
    been visited by one.
-   Halflings have not grown at the rate that the other races have
    grown, and other forms of trade---notably mediated by ships sailing
    along major rivers, and along the coasts---have eclipsed the
    Caravans in the ability to move goods. Because of this, the fortunes
    of Halflings have fallen somewhat.
-   Still, the Caravans remain numerous, and are a vital carrier of
    Commonwealth trade.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 80 Years
    -   Average Height: 1m
    -   Average Weight: 30kg

-   One of the Founding Races. The merchants of the early Commonwealth.
    Though they have fared well as the commonwealth has grown, their
    numbers have never grown as rapidly as other races' have.
-   DUR 25, STR 20
-   +5 COO, +5 INT, +5 SAV, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Halfling
-   Language Group: HHED
-   *Small*: Halflings are Small
-   *Survivors: *Halflings have a remarkable ability to endure
    adversity. ~~They get +10 on tests to resist hunger, thirst, fear,
    exhaustion and Stress~~. They get +10 on Feat of Endurance tests,
    and tests to resist Stress.

-   Optional Background: Caravaneer

    -   +10 ranks in Barter, +10 ranks in one Profession, +10 ranks in
        one Technical or Social skill.
    -   1 Medium Trade Goods, 1 Skill Kit

### []{#anchor-75}Herder

-   Herders are tall, thin and *roughly* humanoid---besides the layer of
    short fur, the large, deer-like eyes, the antlers and the hooves.
-   They are also *extremely* fast, and more than a little skittish.
-   The Herder where a tribal society that existed in the far West of
    the Emerald Plane.
-   Though distant from the Shade Elves, they were still within their
    reach, because the Shade Elves where commonly mounted and could
    strike far to the North.
-   The Herders formed an alliance with several other nearby tribal
    cultures, including a tribal Gnollish culture, for defense against
    the Shade Elves.
-   They were first encountered by the Commonwealth in CY 255, and
    peaceful relations where established.

    -   Between 341 an 344, the Shade Elves heavily raided both
        Commonwealth and Herder settlements; the two allied, and
        successfully devastated the Shade Elf raiders.
    -   In CY 349, the Herders signed a treaty with the Commonwealth,
        becoming allies; when the Compact was ratified, the Herders
        formally became members of the Commonwealth.

-   Herders are very social creatures; the live in large settlements in
    the open, grassy plains and gentle hills of the far West of the
    Emerald Plane.

    -   Though they are a primitive tribal society, they cannot digest
        meat efficiently, and so they practice agriculture---using
        inlets cut from rivers to irrigate grain fields and orchards.
        Check that this makes some sense.
    -   They often hunt and trap, as much for the sake of pelt,
        tradition and trade as to feed themselves
    -   Their settlements are often situated near rivers, and they farm
        and fish.
    -   Many of their settlements are still walled, owing to the
        continued risk of Shade Elf raids, even to the present day---and
        despite the heavy presence in the region of Commonwealth guards.

-   They are a traditional and somewhat insular people, and show little
    interest in trade or exchange with the wider Commonwealth.
-   They make excellent archers, and are extremely quick over open
    terrain, which can make them frustrating opponents for Shade Elves,
    and valuable allies for other nearby tribes (and partners for tribal
    gnolls specifically).
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 45 years
    -   Average Height: 2.1m
    -   Average Weight: 75kg

-   Quick, dextrous, sociable and peaceful -- but also weak and frail,
    and they tend to be wary of outsiders. Dangerous at range.
-   DUR 25, STR 25
-   +5 COO, +10 REF, +5 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 6 / 18
-   Senses: Normal, Motion-Sensitive
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Herder
-   Language Group: GR
-   Alert: Herders receive the Alert trait.

-   Optional Background: Herder Tribal Community

    -   You receive 10 ranks in the Fray and Projectile Weapons skills.
    -   You receive 10 ranks in two Social skills or your choice

### []{#anchor-76}Orks

-   Centuries ago, 165 years before the first Commonwealth Charter, orks
    founded cities in the foothills to the West of the World-Spine
    Mountains.
-   They were a tribal society: extended Families allied into Clans, and
    several Clans cooperate to found a city.
-   They were a warlike honor-society

    -   Orcs are large and have poor reflexes; they made poor riders,
        and so they marched to war, with their baggage-train carried by
        oxen. They forced other nearby societies to pay tribute, and
        there-after warred among themselves.
    -   For conflicts within their society, they used a system of
        ritualized combat.
    -   The period before contact with the Commonwealth represents a
        golden age for the orcs, a period of wealth and power---and a
        time of misery for their neighbors.

-   Humans of the Old Empire avoided Orcish lands, using their
    tributaries as a buffer.
-   Centuries later, in CY 91, the Commonwealth began to spread west of
    the World-Spine, incorporating former Imperial human settlements and
    willing tribes alike.

    -   In CY 113, the Commonwealth allows a tributary civilization to
        join; they stop paying tribute, and the orcs sack them.
    -   This leads to a Commonwealth siege of the city that launched the
        attack.
    -   Other orcish cities marshal an army and attempt to break the
        siege; they are defeated.
    -   This leads to 20 years of warfare between the Commonwealth,
        which goes poorly for the Orcs. By CY 131, they are left with no
        tributaries, surrounded by Commonwealth settlements and
        Commonwealth-allied tribes.

-   There follows a time of misery. Orcs had inadequate local farming
    and industry; without tribute, their society falls into decline.

    -   It's riven by internal conflict, as individuals, families and
        clans battle over the wealth and power they have.
    -   The Orcish population undergoes a contraction, and their cities
        and roads suffer great damage.

-   A generation or Orcs grows up in misery, look out at the
    Commonwealth. Some go to explore it, and return.

    -   In CY 154, the orc Odna returns from exploring the Commonwealth,
        and begins to advocate for a radical course: joining the
        Commonwealth and subscribing to their laws.
    -   Through CY 155, he challenges his own clan head, and then a
        champion of the clans of his city; he wins both challenges, and
        his city (the city of Akala) joins the Commonwealth.
    -   Similar movements prevail in two other orcish cities.

-   Today, Orcs have been members of the Commonwealth for almost 700
    years.

    -   Orcish culture struggled to adapt itself to Commonwealth law and
        tradition: today, it is a blend of traditional orcish elements,
        and imports from the rest of the Commonwealth.
    -   Their views on the Commonwealth and their place within it are
        complex. Though they take pride in being members of an ascendant
        and prosperous people, they also remember how they came to be
        members in it---the most traditional among their numbers claim
        that they were conquered, and that they still bear the shame of
        it.
    -   Most have taken the view that great works and labors are also
        achievements worthy of honor and glory---although their most
        traditional still believe that victory in combat is the greatest
        honor.
    -   Though some orcs remain within their ancient borders and
        practice a (modified) version of their traditions, others travel
        beyond their borders, seeking honor and accomplishment (and to
        bring wealth home, since Orcish communities still do not have
        adequate farming).
    -   Unsurprisingly, many Orcs seek honor and recognition in the
        Commonwealth military. Orcs are quite strong, and so many seek
        work as laborers---orcish cities actually boast impressive
        architecture. Orcs can be quite clever, and some even seek honor
        and achievement in the Commonwealth's universities (orcish
        scholars are generally not known for being nurturing and
        understanding mentors).
    -   Notably, many Elvish communities exist near Orcish ones. Most
        orcs and elves have good relations, as they are both tribal
        cultures and have long lived near each other---for most, their
        time of conflict is centuries past and forgotten. Still, a few
        of the most traditional---in both communities---keep ancient
        grudges alive.

-   The Orcish people can claim 6 major cities: five are their
    traditional cities, and the sixth was established on the
    Commonwealth's border with the Shade Elves. Of the orcs five
    traditional cities, three are members of the Commonwealth, and the
    remaining two are not.

    -   When dealing with each other, orcs use their ancient customs,
        and orcs come and go between the Commonwealth and independent
        cities freely.
    -   As a historical note, the city of Tonilac changed hands once: it
        was claimed by honorable combat by independent orcs, before
        being reclaimed by the Commonwealth six years later.
    -   The city of Collac is the city the Orcs built on the Shade Elf
        border; it is heavily fortified, and the orcs there skirmish
        constantly with the Shade Elves, their allies, and their
        subjugate peoples.

-   Orcs are roughly humanoid. They are tall, lean and muscular. Their
    skin is typically either green, brown, or red; most clans will have
    one skin tone that is more common among them. Orcs also have
    prominent tusks.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 60 years
    -   Average Height: 2.2m
    -   Average Weight: 90kg

-   Physically large an opposing, orcs seek honor and accomplishment in
    all things.

    -   1 weapon and 1 skill kit.

-   Cultural Weapon: Orcish Sabre

    -   Orcs traditionally use a sword and shield when fighting. They
        commonly use a large back-sword---a sword with one edge, because
        they are easier to produce in large numbers. The tips are
        commonly sharpened to a point, so that they may be used for
        thrusting.
    -   Bladed Weapons: 2d10+4+DB, AP -2

        -   One-Handed

-   Cultural Weapon: Orcish Sword

    -   When Orcs fight as a unit, they use an unusual pole-arm. It
        consists of double-sided, sword-like blade, perhaps 45cm long,

    -   The sword-end sometimes also sports guard-like blades at its
        base.

### []{#anchor-77}Ratfolk

-   More than 500 years ago, there was a Ratfolk civilization in the
    Warren Isles, an island chain off the Southwest near the Haven
    Isles.
-   They were organized into warrens run by families, and practiced
    fishing and farming.
-   Shortly before the Haven Isles where settled, some stronger clans
    began to subjugate their neighbors, centralizing power.
-   Shortly after the Haven Isles where settled, Shade Elves begin
    raiding the Ratfolk, and large numbers of Ratfolk begin fleeing
    their original home. Some travel north to the Haven Isles, where
    they are eventually incorporated into the Commonwealth; others flee
    South and settle on Raptor's Plane, where they coexist with Raptors.
-   There are now 3 distinct Ratfolk cultures:

    -   they have a large population in the Commonwealth, first in the
        Haven Isles and now spreading throughout Heartland;
    -   they are one of the two founders of the Raptor's Alliance,
        formed with the raptors to repel Shaded Sea Peoples, including
        their "cousins";
    -   the Shaded Sea Peoples, a society consisting of Ratfolk and
        Shade Elf families.

-   Natural traders and merchants; in the Commonwealth, Ratfolk tend to
    get along well with Halflings and Humans.
-   As scavengers, they also get along well with Gnolls; Ratfolk are one
    of the few species that can eat the same food.
-   Ratfolk are one of the Commonwealth's subterranean cultures; they
    often dwell in underground burrows.
-   Though Ratfolk do maintain their own culture and tradition, they
    were heavily assimilated into the established Commonwealth culture
    that sheltered them.
-   They are comfortable in urban environments and often live beside
    other races and cultures. They are comfortable above-ground and
    underground, and often work as traders and artisans.
-   Uniquely Ratfolk settlements are often organized around warrens;
    similar to Dwarven holds, they are mixed above-ground and
    subterranean structures. They still maintain fishing and seafaring
    traditions.
-   They commonly speak Haven Isles Ratfolk (language group GR).
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 55 Years
    -   Average Height: 1.25m
    -   Average Weight: 34kg

-   Traders and merchants, they tend to get along well with Halflings
    and Gnolls (they're one of few species that can eat Gnollish food
    and speak Gnollish languages). Taking very well to settled urban
    life, and growing very quickly.
-   DUR 25, STR 20
-   +5 COG, +5 COO, +5 REF, +5 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Infra-Red, Scent
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Ratfolk
-   Language Group: GR
-   *Small*: Ratfolk are small
-   *Scavengers*: Rat-Folk are resistant to food-borne diseases. They
    receive +20 on checks against food-borne diseases.

-   Optional Background: Warren Isles Sea-Rat

    -   The more sophisticated of the Shaded Sea People, Ratfolk are the
        shipwrights and sailors of the alliance.
    -   They are still divided into Clan-oriented settlements, where
        each Clan consists of several family, each of which will
        maintain a warren and holdings.
    -   They are loosely confederated, amongst themselves and with Shade
        Elves.
    -   +10 ranks in Intimidate, +10 ranks in Profession: Pirate, +10
        Ranks in one combat skill
    -   One cost: Medium weapon, one Profession: Pirate skill kit
    -   I'm not sure about that, because I'm not sure what would be in
        it.
    -   Warren Isles Sea-Rats don't receive 10 ranks in Language:
        Common. Instead, they receive 10 ranks Shade Elven. They
        commonly speak Warren Isles Ratfolk (language group GF)
        natively.

-   Optional Background: Raptor's Plane Ratfolk

    -   The descendants of Ratfolk who fled Southward from their
        cousins, settled on the Raptor's Plane and ultimately allied
        with the Raptors.
    -   They settled on the coasts and inland jungles closest to their
        cousins, and continue to suffer heavy raiding.
    -   Inland, they live in large, underground settlements, carved into
        the sides of rocky foothills.
    -   On the shores, where burrowing is impractical, they live in a
        walled cities of a few thousand.
    -   Still socially-inclined and natural traders, they have opened
        trade with the Commonwealth (and have been surprised to
        encounter their distant cousins in the Commonwealth's fleets).
    -   They still fish and trade along rivers and shores, although
        Shaded Sea piracy makes this dangerous.
    -   +10 Ranks in Protocol, +10 Ranks in one Combat skill, +10 Ranks
        in one Trade Skill
    -   One cost: Medium weapon, one Skill Kit.
    -   Raptor's Plane Ratfolk don't gain 10 ranks in Common; instead,
        they gain 10 ranks in Raptor. They usually speak Jungle Ratfolk
        as a native language.

### []{#anchor-78}Shamblers

-   Shamblers are spirits bound to plants.
-   They originated in the dense marshes of the Southern lowlands to the
    East of the World-Spine Mountains.
-   They were created when Father Cypress, a Great Spirit who admired
    mortals and wished to interact with them, created plants with
    internal processes that could support Spirits, and fashioned of
    himself Spirits who could dwell within them.
-   Owing to their ability to root, Shambler communities lack cleared
    fields and grazing-lands---they also tend to have an active night
    life.
-   Despite being the children of a Great Spirit associated with
    isolated, deep swamps, Shamblers can be surprisingly urbane; they
    are welcoming of outsiders, and host many artisans and traders.
-   Shamblers are inquisitive, and their ability to root makes them
    light travelers; they therefore spawn many adventurers, explorers
    and wanderers.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: Unknown
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 60kg

-   Spirits bound to plants.
-   DUR 35, STR 30
-   +10 INT, +5 SOM, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Mage-Sight
-   Tags: Supernatural, Humanoid, Shambler
-   Language Groups: HHED
-   *Rooting*: shamblers can *root*: when rooted, shamblers look more
    like natural trees (they may attempt a Disguise check to pass as a
    natural tree). While rooted, Shamblers have Fast Healing 2.

    -   It is a one minute Task Action to either root or unroot.
    -   If a shambler roots for 1 hour (in a location with access to
        sunlight, in good soil), then they will not need to otherwise
        eat, sleep or drink for 24 hours.

-   Optional Background: Shambler Community

    -   10 ranks in one Profession and one Craft skill.
    -   10 ranks in Survival.
    -   1 Skill Kit.

### []{#anchor-79}Tempters

-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: None
    -   Average Height: by shape
    -   Average Weight: by shape

-   shape-shifting spirit beings. Charming and suave, but also very
    frail. They can shape shift freely. They tend to live in urban
    centers among other races. Some Tempters live openly among the large
    cities of the Commonwealth; more almost certainly live in secret.
-   DUR 20, STR 20
-   +5 INT, +10 SAV, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Shape-Dependant (Flight 5 / 15 / 60, Foot 4 / 12 or Swim 4
    / 12)
-   Senses: Normal, Mage-Sight
-   Tags: Spirit, Shape-Shifter, Tempter
-   Language Group: Shape-Dependant (HHED / GR / DDK)
-   *Appearance of Flesh*: Tempters are Spirits, and thus they do not
    age, do not need to eat, drink or breath, and do not need to sleep.
    However, even though they are Spirits, they are physical beings (and
    thus, their bodies may be wounded, and they may be killed, using all
    the rules for normal creatures). More than that, it is required of
    them that their form always resemble that of a flesh-and-blood
    creature -- although the details of their form are otherwise up to
    them.
-   *Shape-Shifting*: Tempters can take the form of any medium-sized
    natural creature. They can control the details of their physical
    form as they wish, including being able to mimic specific
    individuals.

    -   They can change shape as a Standard Action.
    -   They have fine control over their appearance. They can mimic a
        specific individual; this requires a Disguise check at +20.
    -   Changing shape does not affect their statistics; however, as
        listed above, they receive appropriate movement modes and
        natural attacks.

-   Note: as Spirits, Tempters are immediately obvious to anyone with
    Mage-Sight.

-   Optional Negative Trait: Bind

    -   You have a *bind*, the details of which you should work out with
        your GM. The bind should pose a real danger to you. It must be
        known to at least one clerical organization in the area where
        you live -- although it does not need to be widely known. (This
        is a negative trait; it you select it, you *gain* 10 CP, which
        you may then spend elsewhere.)

### []{#anchor-80}Wood Elves

-   There are many Elvish communities scattered through the deep forests
    and rolling hills of the western inlands.

    -   Though many tribes have joined the Commonwealth as members, for
        the most part, they have been content to practice their
        traditional way of life in the deep forests to the West of the
        World-Spine Mountain.

-   Elves are a tribal society: they build small permanent settlements,
    where the young, old and infirm live, while able-bodied adults
    travel the nearby forests hunting, foraging and herding.

    -   There are many distinct and independent elvish cultures, as
        their population is distributed in many small pockets through a
        swath of the Emerald Plane more than 300 miles across.
    -   They share this vast territory with many other tribal
        communities, including tribes of humans, gnolls and other races.
    -   They interact far more often with the other peoples around them
        than they do with their distant kin, and so their culture often
        resembles that of their neighbors more than it does that of
        distant elves.

-   Some very traditional (and, necessarily, very small) Elvish
    societies do not even practice settled agriculture: their adults
    hunt and forage in the woodlands nearby.

    -   Others practice different types of agriculture, with adults
        herding in the nearby woodlands.
    -   Some elvish communities practice subsistence farming, relying on
        seasonal rises in the rivers to irrigate wheat and rice fields.
    -   Others have developed workable if simple irrigation schemes, and
        use them for larger-scale farming.
    -   Some have even imported sophisticated farming techniques (and
        crops) from the wider Commonwealth, and produce a food surplus
        for trade.

-   Hunting is frequently an important cultural practice in Elvish
    communities.
-   Those elves that do depart the tribal lands to settle among the
    wider Commonwealth frequently join Ash Elf communities---indeed,
    given their long lifespans, many young Ash Elves grow up knowing
    their "first generation" Wood Elven ancestors, and pure-blooded Wood
    (and Shade) elves are not an uncommon site in Ash Elven communities.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 250 years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   Quick in mind and body, many tribal Elvish communities still exist.
-   DUR 25, STR 25
-   +10 INT, +10 REF
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light

-   Language Group: HHED
-   Keen Senses: Wood Elves receive +20 to visual Perception checks, and
    +10 to auditory perception checks.
-   Ready: You gain the Ready trait. I'd like something more
    interesting, but this will work for now.

-   Optional Background: Wood-Elf Tribal Community

    -   You receive 10 ranks in Fray, Ranged Weapons, Survival and
        Stealth.

[]{#anchor-81}Neighboring races
-------------------------------

### []{#anchor-82}Goblins

### []{#anchor-83}Raptors

-   These small creatures, as like a reptile as a bird, are one of the
    races originally inhabiting the Raptor's Plane.
-   They walk upright, are covered in dark-green scales, and feature
    vibrant feathers as plumage on their heads, arms, and on their short
    tails.
-   Though they are warm-blooded, they don't handle extremes of
    temperature very well, and are most comfortable in the humid jungles
    of Raptor's Plane.
-   They have powerful legs and nasty claws, and are natural climbers
    and leapers.
-   Hundreds of years ago, they were a society of tribal hunters: the
    young and old lived in settlements, while the healthy ranged and
    hunted in the thick jungles.
-   Contact with the Ratfolk brought them access to worked iron and
    bronze, and the two collaborated to adapt Ratfolk farming techniques
    to the deep jungle; these have helped revolutionize Raptor culture.
-   Though many of them are still hunters, they have expanded the scale
    of their agriculture significantly, and trade with Ratfolk burrows
    for finished weapons and tools.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 50 years
    -   Average Height: 1.65m
    -   Average Weight: 45kg

-   DUR 30, STR 35

-   Senses: Normal, Scent
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Saurian, Raptor
-   Language Group: DDK
-   Scales: Raptors are covered in small scales; these provide them +1
    Armor.
-   Claws: Raptors have vicious claws on their feat, designed to grapple
    prey when pounced on from above. The have the following natural
    weapon:

    -   Unarmed Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -2. Tags: Natural, Grab,
        Awkward Placement: Legs
    -   Special: Your talons are difficult to use, being on your feet;
        they require that you pounce on someone from above, leap on them
        and pin them, or use some other similar tactic to bring them to
        bear.
    -   Special: Your talons are very good at gripping those you attack,
        digging in through flesh and bone as you do so. When attacking
        with your talons, if you score an exceptional success, you
        automatically grab your opponent.

### []{#anchor-84}Shade Elves

-   These dark-skinned cousins to Wood Elves hail from the rolling hills
    and grasslands of the extreme Southwestern edge of the Emerald
    Plane.
-   They have long been a raiding culture, terrorizing other cultures
    near them.
-   Hundreds of years ago, early Commonwealth settlers allied with
    Herders and built heavily fortified settlements; a disastrous
    large-scale raid against one of these fortifications cost them
    heavily, which left them vulnerable to the Leapers, who invaded from
    below.
-   To meet the Leaper's demands, they turned to raiding the Warren
    Isles Ratfolk, until, weakened, the Leapers also assaulted the
    Ratfolk. The Leapers eventually forced their two tributaries into
    cooperation, forming the Shaded Sea Peoples.
-   They have heavily raided and been largely expelled from both the
    Commonwealth and the Raptor's Plane Alliance. They are still
    opportunistically raid both, and still practice piracy, with the aid
    of Ratfolk sailors.
-   To meet the tributary demands of the Leapers, they have turned to
    brutally subjugating and exploiting the other tribal cultures within
    their reach.
-   Shade Elves typically live in settlements dug into the hills, with
    the bases of slopes ringed by walls. Their settlements are often
    walled and fortified, owing to the need to fend off both slave
    rebellions and other Shade Elf clans.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 250 years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   Keen Senses: Shade Elves receive +20 to visual Perception checks,
    and +10 to auditory perception checks.
-   Cruel: You gain +WIL to tests to resist stress from inflicting
    cruelyt.

-   Optional Background: Shade Elf Raider

    -   You receive 10 Ranks in one combat skill, 10 Ranks in Survival,
        10 ranks in Ride
    -   One Cost: Medium weapon, one Horse. I might Fantasy it up some,
        more than a horse.

[]{#anchor-85}Backgrounds, Traits, Classes and Powers
=====================================================

See the Character Creation rules.

Traits work more or less like EP Traits, and Powers are distantly
inspired by EP Sleights. In terms of this game, Backgrounds give you a
package of skills, traits and items that represent your upbringing,
Traits give you some useful property, Powers give you a special action
you can perform -- usually, and Classes let you "break the rules" in
limited and interesting ways -- for example, Soldier let you use the
Assist action during combat.

[]{#anchor-86}Backgrounds
-------------------------

-   Guidelines

    -   Should give you a few skills, possibly a Trait

        -   should give you *ranks* and not a bonus, because of how
            buying skills works.
        -   Really shouldn't include EP-style "buy at half price", those
            are obscenely strong.
        -   Should probably provide about 40 CP-worth of bonuses

    -   Backgrounds shouldn't give you something you can't get anywhere
        else. Instead, they should give you a "starting package" at no
        cost.
    -   Hint: Backgrounds can award Traits, Classes and even Powers --
        it's not a bad trick for making them more interesting, and it's
        useful if a Class, Trait or Power is important to a given theme.
    -   These backgrounds are general backgrounds -- the kind of
        backgrounds that anybody might have, and that might exist in any
        province. If you want a more specific backgrounds, you can make
        it an optional background for a given race.

[]{#anchor-87}Traits
--------------------

Traits represent special properties about your character. In general,
Traits are not actions; they are always in effect during play.

-   Alert: You are particularly aware of your surroundings. You take no
    penalty to passive Perception tests.
-   Ambidextrous: Choose one of your hands: you may now use that hand as
    well as your dominant hand. Notably, this means that the penalties
    for using an Off-Handed Weapon would not apply when using that hand.
    (Characters with more than two hands may take the Ambidextrous trait
    repeatedly, if they wish to have more of their limbs be "dominant
    hands".)
-   Brave: your character receives a +20 bonus to tests to resist fear
    or intimidation
-   Common Sense: you know a good idea (or a bad one!) when you see it.
    Once per game, you may ask the GM whether some particular action is
    a *good idea* or not; alternatively, the GM may warn you that
    something you are about to do is a *bad idea*.
-   High Pain Tolerance: your character can *negate* the effect of one
    wound.
-   Limber: Your character is very lithe, and receives a +10 bonus on
    checks where this would be beneficial, such as trying to escape
    bindings or squeeze through tight spaces.
-   Ready: you may spend a Luck Point to re-roll your initiative.

    -   original idea: +2 INIT
    -   possible better idea: once per combat, you may move to head of
        the initiative order for the following turn.
    -   Or: roll your INIT twice, and take the best result.
    -   I like both of those more, I think, because I usually prefer
        abilities that are really interesting discretely over ones that
        do a little bit constantly. And also because I prefer people
        invest in good Aptitutdes if they want good numbers. But it
        might also be OK, since INIT isn't a skill and you can't invest
        in it directly.

-   Strong: you are particularly strong. This increases your STR by 5.
-   Tough: you are particularly tough. This increases your DUR by 5;
    this changes your WT and DR as well.

-   These are traits that would be racial features, except I was
    uncomfortable making them unavailable to other characters. I'm still
    deciding if I want them as general traits or not.

    -   \...actually these don't work because you can spend one luck to
        Upgrade *anyway*, that's what it does.
    -   I need to rethink this.

-   Social Animal: You are particularly well suited to large groups and
    complex social situations. After you roll a test that includes your
    SAV, you may spend 1 Luck to Upgrade.
-   Disciplined: You are particularly good at self-control. After you
    roll a test that includes your WIL, you may spend 1 Luck to Upgrade.

Some traits are *negative traits*. A negative trait imposes a *penalty*,
but taking it *gives* you more CP to spend.

-   Distinctive: you have some very distinctive characteristic, which
    makes you very recognizable. You take a -20 penalty on Disguise
    checks, and on Stealth checks to blend into a crowd.
-   Enemy: some foe is determined to see you fall. They might be someone
    who is actively hunting you, they might be someone in a position of
    power who will make your life miserable at every opportunity, or
    they might be something else. In any case, they are a frequent
    source of frustration for you, showing up to foil your plans at the
    worst possible times.
-   Frail: you are not as hardy as other members of your race. This
    decreases your DUR by 5; this alters your DR and WT as well. You
    cannot take both this trait and the Tough trait.
-   Illiterate: You cannot read or write.
-   Meek: No-one would describe you as "brave": you have a -20 penalty
    to tests to resist fear or intimidation. You cannot take both this
    and the Brave trait.
-   Social Stigma: you are part of a group, organization or movement
    that people have a negative view of. You take penalties on Social
    skills (these skills depend heavily on the situation, and are up to
    GM discression). These penalties should apply at least some of the
    time where you live.
-   Wanted: you are wanted by some government, order or noble. You
    occasionally have to hide from bounty-hunters, duck guards, or worry
    about being turned in by any less-than-scrupulous people you
    encounter.
-   Weak: you are weaker than the norm for your race. You have -5 STR.
    You cannot take both this and the Strong trait.

Some traits are *neutral*, giving you both a benefit and a drawback;
they do not cost CP.

-   Hardened: You have been exposed to some source of stress repeatedly,
    and have become resistant to it; however, doing so has taken a toll.

    -   Choose one particular source of stress: you gain +WIL to checks
        made to resist it, but your Luck stat is reduced by 1.
    -   Example sources of stress include *being gravely injured in
        combat;* *failing one of your motivational goals spectacularly;
        witnessing, experiencing or performing torture* and *displays of
        extreme supernatural power.*
    -   Right now, this is borrowed fairly directly from EP, but I'd
        like to adapt it to the game and setting more. Maybe reduce LUC
        by 5 instead?

-   Unique Outlook: You have some personal philosophy or outlook that
    causes you to process some situation vary differently than other
    people do; on the plus side, this allows you to weather some
    situations that others would find stressful, but on the down side,
    this also makes it harder for others to relate to you.

    -   Choose one particular source of Stress: you gain +WIL to checks
        made to resist it, but you suffer a -10 penalty to Persuasion
        and Protocol tests.
    -   Note sure about that one either, I had the idea that instead
        "your critical successes with Social Skills are ignored" or
        something like it.

[]{#anchor-88}Classes
---------------------

-   Guidelines for Creating Classes

    -   Most classes either represent an association (that should be
        useful to players during the game), or let them "cheat" in some
        interesting way (i.e. by stepping around something that's
        normally a rule).

        -   Classes shouldn't give them new actions that they can
            perform: those should be Powers.
        -   Classes shouldn't give players ranks or fixed bonuses in
            skills; that should happen in Backgrounds and Traits.

    -   "20 ranks in 2 skills" is a good rule of thumb for most class
        requirements -- but obviously not all of them
    -   Classes should not be *mandatory* for a given character concept.
        A character with 85 in Bladed Weapons should be a master
        sword-fighter, and should be perfectly effective as a
        sword-fighter without any classes (or powers). So, if you're
        working on a class that would be functionally mandatory for
        every sword-fighter, or that just means "is a master
        sword-fighter," then something has gone wrong.

        -   The biggest exception are Classes that directly represent a
            social role, like Noble and Officer.

-   Class whose names are italicized are dependent on specific locals,
    spirits or characters, and so won't make sense "just anywhere." They
    are intended more as examples of the kinds of things that players
    might come up with to customize their characters, or that GMs might
    use to "flesh out" a unique local.

-   Artisan of the Dead

    -   Requirements: 30 Ranks in Spellcraft, the Corpse-Herder class
    -   You can modify your corpse companion. Such a modification
        requires time, raw materials and an appropriate Spellcraft
        check. Possible modifications are listed below:
    -   Armored: your companion gains 4 armor. Requires: 1 hour
        task-action, a corpse, scraps of armor.
    -   Monstrous: you heavily strengthen and reinforce your companion,
        which gains +5 STR and +10 DUR. Requires: 1 hour task-action,
        two corpses.
    -   Hulk: your companion is a heavily-armored hulk capable of
        shrugging off massive damage. Its gains 6 more armor (so that it
        has a total of 10 armor). Requires: 2 hour task-action, one
        corpse, armor scraps; companion must have Armored and Monstrous
        traits.
    -   Fast: you carefully craft your companion to be lean and quick.
        It's walking movement is increased to 5/15. Requires: 2 hour
        task action, a corpse. Cannot have the armored or monstrous
        options.
    -   Flight: you attach great wings to your companion, allowing it to
        fly. It gains flying movement 4/12. Requires: 2 hour task
        action, large amounts of hide. Cannot have the armored or
        monstrous options.
    -   Claws: you graft ferocious claws onto your companion's hands and
        feet. It gains claws that do 1d10 DV + 4 + DB damage, and have
        AP -2. Requires a thirty-minute task action, claws or scrap
        metal.

-   Attendant of the Mourner

    -   Requirements: 20 Ranks in one Combat skill, 20 Ranks in
        Research, the Cleric class.
    -   You are a devotee of the Mourner, and you have pledged yourself
        to the pursuit of history and (enlightened) justice.
    -   In a site holy to the Mourner (a library, museum, court-house or
        similar), or while pursuing a perpetrator of cruelty or
        injustice on a great scale, before making a Combat skill check,
        a Research check, an Intimidate check or a check to Resist Fear,
        you may spend 1 Luck Point to gain +WIL to your check.

-   Channeler

    -   Requirement: 20 ranks in Control, two Sleights
    -   You have such long experience with your sleights that
        maintaining them is almost automatic. You reduce the penalty for
        sustaining Sleights by 10. (So, for example, if you are
        sustaining 4 Sleights, you take a -20 penalty to all checks,
        instead of the normal -30.)

-   Corpse-Herder

    -   Requirement: 20 Ranks in Spellcraft, 10 ranks in Knowledge:
        Theology
    -   You can create a powerful companion from the remains of the
        dead---and you can heal and modify your companion with more
        remains.
    -   You can create a companion as a one-hour Task Action requiring a
        Spellcraft check; you need access to at least one corpse (of
        medium size or larger) to provide raw material.
    -   When you create your companion, it has DUR 30, STR 30, and a
        movement of Walking 4/12. It only a very rudimentary
        intelligence: it has SOM 15 and WILL 20, and a score of 5 in its
        other attributes. (You create this basic intelligence, it does
        not come from the corpse you used.)
    -   Your companion will obey any simple command you give it; absent
        orders from you, it will follow you and defend you.
    -   When you create your companion, you may distribute 200 ranks
        among its various skills. You cannot assign it more than ten
        ranks in any Knowledge skill, and you cannot assign it more
        ranks in a skill than you have.
    -   Your companion has the Supernatural tag, and does not need to
        eat, drink, sleep or breath. It is unaffected by poison and
        disease (though it can carry diseases).
    -   Your companion doesn't heal naturally, and Medicine is useless
        on it. However, you may attempt to repair it if it is damaged.
        If you have a corpse to work with, you may attempt to repair it;
        this is a thirty-minute Task Action requiring a Spellcraft
        check. If you succeed, one wound is removed, and your companion
        recovers 1d10 DV. (Note, the wound is *removed*, not bound.)

-   Daredevil

    -   You have a history of taking extraordinary risks, and a habit of
        succeeding.

-   Duelist

    -   Requirements: 20 Ranks in one Melee Skill
    -   As a Quick Action, you can designate one other Creature as your
        Rival. You gain a +10 bonus to checks to combat skills that your
        target is opposing (that is, to your attack when attacking them,
        and to your defense when defending against them). However, you
        take -10 to combat skills that your Rival isn't opposing (that
        is, when attacking other characters, or when defending against
        other characters).

        smuggling runs, intimidating targets or crafting drugs.

[]{#anchor-89}Powers
--------------------

Powers generally list the type of action they require, and the effect
when used. Some powers also have prerequisites. Note that a "power" is
not necessarily supernatural: martial maneuvers also use the same rules,
and are thus listed here.

-   Fireball: You can manifest a fireball in your hand.

    -   Requires: 10 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Effect: held ball of fire

        -   After it is created, treat the ball of fire as you would any
            other held object. The ball of fire will not burn you or any
            possession that you are in contact with, but it will burn
            other objects (or people).
        -   If the ball of fire looses contact with you (as it will if
            it is thrown, for example), it can persist for up to 5 turns
            (about 15 seconds) on its own; otherwise, it can persist as
            long as you hold on to it.
        -   You can voluntarily dismiss the ball of fire (which is
            handy, because sleeping with a ball of fire in your hand is
            ill-advised).
        -   The ball of fire is, of course, fire, and effects other
            objects as such. (For example, it will burn other people for
            2d10 DV.)

-   Exploding Fireball:

    -   Requires: Fireball and 20 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   When using the Fireball power, when your fireball expires
        (either because you dismissed it or because it left contact with
        you), you may choose to have it explode. Treat this as a Blast
        effect, which does (your fireball's damage) at its center.

-   Intense Fire:

    -   Requires: 20 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Effect: Your fire spells do an additional 1d10 DV of damage and
        have AP -1.

-   Jump

    -   Requires: 10 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Effect: You teleport, moving up to twice your Running movement.

-   Group Jump

    -   Requires: Jump, 20 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Effect: when you teleport ~~using Jump, Long Jump, Journey or
        Pilot~~, you may take objects or other people with you. You may
        carry either one normal-sized person or 50 Kg of cargo per 10
        ranks in Spellcraft.

-   Long Jump

    -   Requires: Jump, 20 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Effect: You teleport, moving up to 10 times your Running
        movement.

-   Journey

    -   Requires: Long Jump, 30 ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Task Action (1 minute)
    -   Effect: You teleport, moving up to ~~2 kilometers per meter of
        running movement~~ 2 kilometer per 10 ranks in Spellcraft.

-   Pilot

    -   Requires: Journey, Group Jump
    -   Action: Task Action (10 minutes)
    -   Effect: You can use a Kairne to teleport; when you do so, you
        can teleport to any other Kairne in the network.

-   Master

    -   Requires: 10 Control
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: You can use your own intrinsic magic to control (and
        fortify) your own life processes.

        -   While sustaining this power, you receive a +20 bonus to
            checks to Endure Physical Hardship.
        -   While sustaining this power, you gain +1 Armor.

-   Transcend

    -   Requires: Master, 20 Control
    -   Action: None
    -   You have permanently integrated magical energies into your own
        life processes.
    -   Effect:

        -   You gain the Empowered tag;
        -   you receive a +10 bonus to tests to Endure Physical
            Hardship;
        -   you only need to eat and sleep half as much, and
        -   you gain +1 Armor.

-   Down-Time

    -   Requires: Transcend, 20 Control
    -   Action: 4-Hour Task Action
    -   You can enter a deep, meditative state, in which you can
        nourish, refresh and repair both your mind and body.
    -   Effect:

        -   After you use this Sleight, you do not need to eat or sleep
            for 1 day.
        -   After completing the Sleight, you recover 1 Stress.
        -   While sustaining this Sleight, you are very difficult to
            wake; other people will need to shake you violently to wake
            you (a Standard Action). Other similarly violent actions
            will wake you---if the building you are in collapses, or if
            you are attacked, for example. If you are roused from the
            Sleight before it completes, you suffer a -10 penalty from
            the exhaustion and disorientation for 1 day.
        -   Special: if you have the Heal Sleight, you may also sustain
            it during Down Time.

-   Fortify

    -   Requires: 20 Control
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: you can fortify your physical and mental abilities.

        -   While you sustain this Sleight, you may receive a +5 bonus
            to one Aptitude, or to your Strength, or to your Durability.
            (If you change your Durability, then the stats that depend
            on it also change, for the duration of the Sleight.)

-   Heal

    -   Requires: 10 Control
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: Your wounds begin to heal.

        -   While sustaining this power, you have Fast Healing 1.
        -   While sustaining this power, you may attempt a Control check
            as a Quick Action; if you succeed, you instead have Fast
            Healing 2.
        -   Special: if you have a few minutes to focus yourself (i.e.,
            when you are out of combat), the GM may allow you to
            progress to Fast Healing 2 without requiring a check.

-   Transfer

    -   Requires: 10 Control
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Condition: To use this power, you must be touching one other
        creature (which must have a DUR rating). ~~This creature is the
        target.~~
    -   Effects: You transfer wounds from a creature that you touch to
        yourself.

        -   For every turn that you sustain this power, you take 2 DV;
            if you do, the creature you are touching is either healed
            healed for 2 DUR, or one ongoing bleed effect is ended (you
            choose which).
        -   This power cannot "transfer" wounds in this way, nor can it
            heal diseases, congenital defects or poisons.

-   Regrowth

    -   Requires: Heal, 20 Control
    -   Action: Task Action (1 Hour)
    -   Effect: Roll a Control check. If you succeed, you heal one
        wound.

-   Sacrifice

    -   Requires: Transfer, 20 Control
    -   Action: Task Action (1 minute)
    -   Condition: To use this power, you must be sustaining Transfer
    -   Effect: You suffer one wound; if you do, the person you are
        Transfer-ing wounds from is healed for one wound.
    -   Using sacrifice can be stressfull. A WIL \* 3 test can be called
        for to use this power; if the power is used successfully, Stress
        might be inflicted.

-   Join

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Control
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Condition: To use this Power, you must be touching one
        character; this character is the target of the Power. If you
        loose physical contact with the target, the power ends.
    -   Effect: You join minds with the target, creating a Gestalt.
        Normally, this is an equal blending; however, under some
        circumstances -- particularly if the target is unwilling -- the
        two minds might fight for dominance over the Gestalt. Treat this
        as an opposed WIL \* 3 check, with the winner gaining dominance,
        and thereafter being able to direct the actions of the gestalt.
    -   The gestalt mind has access to the skills, knowledge and
        memories of both individuals. The gestalt mind will also express
        the desires of both minds -- even if one mind has become
        dominant, the other mind in the Gestalt cannot be suppressed
        completely.
    -   Unsurprisingly, this can be extremely traumatic -- this is
        almost always the case when the target is unwilling.
    -   Physical action is very difficult, given that one character must
        maintain physical contact with another -- but it can be
        attempted. Appropriate penalties apply (usually -30).
    -   For simplicity, assume that the Gestalt functions as one
        character, at least in so far as it has one initiative score and
        has the same allotment of actions that any individual character
        would have.

-   Link

    -   Requires: Join, 20 Ranks in Control
    -   Action: Task Action (5 minutes)
    -   Condition: To use this power, you must be sustaining Join.
    -   While sustaining Join, you can Link your mind with the target.
        Thereafter, as long as you continue to sustain Join, you can
        break physical contact with the target and maintain the Gestalt.
        This makes physical action far more feasible.
    -   The targets cannot get more than (Your ranks in Control) \* 2
        meters apart from one-another, or the effect ends.

-   Collective

    -   Requires: Join, Link, 30 Ranks in Control
    -   Condition: You must be sustaining Join, and you must have Linked
        with the target.
    -   You can incorporate more than one mind into the Gestalt created
        by Join. To add a new mind, you must use Join on that mind, and
        you must then Link that mind.
    -   To remain in the Gestalt, ever element of the collective must be
        within the given range of at least one other element of the
        collective (they can form a chain).
    -   Fights for dominance among collectives are more complicated.
        Generally, only two participants should be rolling against each
        other at any given time. Minds who can co-exist peacefully can
        nominate the strongest among them to represent their interests,
        and they can even potentially assist one-another. However, being
        a component of a large collective that is not at peace with
        itself can be a traumatic experience for all involved, even the
        "victors" in the fight for dominance.

-   Shield Bash

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Blunt Weapons
    -   Effect: you can hurt people with a shield about as well as other
        people can with a weapon. You can use your shield as a weapon,
        using your Blunt Weapons skill and doing 2d10 DV (AP -).

-   Sneak Attack

    -   Requires: 10 ranks in an Attack skill.
    -   Effect: You are particularly good at striking weak spots. When
        you attack an unaware or helpless target, you inflict an
        additional 1d10 DV.

-   Blur

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Spellcraft, 10 Ranks in Stealth
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: You become translucent, making you hard to spot.

        -   You gain +10 bonus to Stealth checks to avoid being seen.

-   Vanish

    -   Requires: Blur, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft, 20 Ranks in Stealth
    -   Effect: Your Blur improves; you become so difficult to spot that
        others may fail to notice you even if you are standing in plain
        sight.

        -   You gain (another) +10 bonus to Stealth checks to avoid
            being seen.
        -   You may use Stealth to avoid being seen even if you do not
            have anything to hide behind. Such a Stealth check suffers a
            -20 modifier.

-   Feint

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in an Melee Skill, 10 Ranks in Deception
    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Effect: With a quick flourish, false thrust or shift of posture,
        you can ably mislead opponents in combat.

        -   Choose one opponent who you could attack with a melee
            weapon; make an opposed test, your Deception versus their
            Resist Social Manipulation. If you succeed, they suffer a
            -20 penalty to their tests to defend until their next turn.

    -   Hmmm, does this need to be a power, or could we allow GMs to
        adjudicate this ad-hoc? If it wasn't a power, I'd probably allow
        a player to just *do this*.

-   Charm

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Persuasion, 10 Ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Task Action (5 Minutes)
    -   Effect: Conversation with you is enchanting, in a very literal
        sense.

        -   As you spend time in conversation with someone, you can
            exert a magical influence over them.
        -   Make an opposed test, your Persuasion versus their Resist
            Social Manipulation (SAV + INT). If you succeed, they will
            regard you as a friend, and will view your words and actions
            in the best possible light.
        -   This does not grant you magical control of their actions, it
            simply implies that they will trust you and regard you
            favorably.

-   Push

    -   Requires: Charm, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Effect: you have the ability to "push" your will onto other
        people.

        -   When you Charm someone, you may attempt a Persuasion check,
            opposed by their Resist Social Manipulation. If you win,
            then you may give them a single instruction, which they will
            carry out to the best of their ability.

    -   Not sure about this one, did it quick. Wanted to avoid this with
        the base Charm; mind control can get obscene.

-   Weave:

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Athletics, 10 Ranks in Fray
    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Effect: You are particularly good at evasive movement.

        -   In combat, you may take a Standard Action to *move
            evasively*. You may move up to your running rate. Until the
            beginning of your next turn, you may defend with your
            Athletics skill, and you gain +20 to your defenses.
        -   You don't have to actually move from your space to use this
            power. Using Weave without moving might represent focusing
            all your attention on parrying incoming blows, for example.
        -   You get the +20 bonus to checks made to defend yourself,
            whether you use Athletics to defend or not. You can defend
            with Fray and still get the +20 bonus, for example.

-   Quick Counter:

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Unarmed Combat dunno about that
    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Effect: You are very good at countering your opponents attacks
        with a nasty joint lock.

        -   Until the beginning of your next turn, if you are attacked
            in melee, defend with your Unarmed Skill, win the opposed
            check (that is, successfully defend against an attack), and
            score an Exceptional Success, then you automatically grapple
            the person who attacked you.

-   Quick Break:

    -   Requires: Quick Counter, 20 Ranks in Unarmed Combat
    -   Effect: when you counter an opponent, you may instead choose to
        break a joint.

        -   When you Quick Counter an opponent, instead of grappling
            them, you may choose to inflict a single Wound.

-   Blank

    -   Requires: 20 Ranks in Deception
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: though it requires some concentration, you have an
        uncanny ability to blank your expression, replacing it with
        pleasant neutral demeanor.

        -   While sustaining this power, Read checks made against you
            suffer a -30 penalty.
        -   However, because your neutral expression makes it hard to
            convey your emotional state---and might be a little
            unnerving. You suffer a -10 penalty to Persuasion checks.
        -   Having no penalty to Barter is deliberate, the theory being
            that this kind of behavior is expected while haggling;
            likewise, no bonus on Deception was offered, because a bonus
            to one side of a check coupled with a penalty to the other
            is a little stiff. Thoughts?
        -   This isn't a supernatural power; it's just having a really
            good poker face. Therefore, it's neither a Sleight, a Spell,
            a Boon or a Maneuver; it's basically just a Power.

-   Threaten

    -   Requires: 7 INIT, 20 Ranks in one Melee Combat Skill.
    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Effect: you attempt to prevent your foes from moving past you.

        -   Until your next turn, whenever any foe first approaches you
            or attempts to move past you, you may choose to attack them,
            using all the rules for attacking as a Standard Action.
            (This only triggers the first time any foe approaches you.)
        -   The attack doesn't prevent them from moving past you
            (unless, of course, it knocks them over or disables them).
        -   It is obvious to opponents that you are poised to attack,
            and they may choose to avoid you.
        -   I don't want to put Attacks of Opportunity in the game, but
            I want a mechanic that allows fighter-types to control an
            area. This is a first blush, but feedback is required.

-   Conjure

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: you can form magic into physical forms, which can mimic
        simple objects.

        -   While you sustain this power, you can create either three
            items with cost category Minor, or one object with cost
            category Medium.
        -   You choose the objects when you first use the Power.
        -   The objects cannot have complex clockwork, cannot be
            alchemical or otherwise magic, and cannot sustain chemical
            reactions; you can form cups, knives, jugs, bags, and
            blades, for example; but you cannot summon potions,
            explosives, clocks, food or living creatures.
        -   The objects you form are partially translucent, and glow
            with a ghostly energy; though you can control their
            appearance up to a point, they are obviously magical
            creations.
        -   The objects works just like their mundane versions; they
            don't hover or act on their own, for example.

-   Eidolon:

    -   Don't like the name
    -   Requires: Conjure, 10 Ranks in Control, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: you can form magic into the shape of a living creature,
        and you can fracture your mind so that you can control them.

        -   You get one creature, hereafter called an Eidolon.
        -   Each Eidolon is Small, has 15 DUR and 20 STR, has a movement
            of Walking 3/9, has Normal Senses, and has the Spirit,
            Humanoid and Eidolon tags. As magical apparitions, they
            don't need to eat, drink, breath or sleep.
        -   The Eidolon does not have a mind of its own; rather, you
            control its actions, as if it was an extension of your body.
            This means that it uses your Aptitudes and Skill Ranks;
            appropriate powers, classes and traits may also be used
            through your Eidolon, at the GM's discretion.
        -   Mechanically, the Eidolon gets a turn of its own; it acts on
            your initiative, after your turn.
        -   Mechanically, the you can use your actions to either act
            through your Character, or to have your Eidolon act. So, for
            example, during your turn you could use a Quick Action to
            have your character move, and a Standard Action to attack
            with your Eidolon.
        -   You may choose three bonuses for the Eidolon from the
            Bonuses list.

    -   Bonuses:

        -   Carapace: the Eidolon has a sturdy shell, thick hide, or is
            otherwise reinforced; it gains 4 Armor.
        -   Claws: the Eidolon gains claws:

            -   Attack: Unarmed Combat, 1D10+1+DB, -2 AP; Tags: Natural
                Weapon, Off-Hand.

        -   Form: the Eidolon gains the appearance of an animal; it
            appears to be a normal creature of the given type. (Its
            stats don't change, and it is immediately obvious to anyone
            with Mage Sight that it is a magical conjuration.)
        -   Regen: the Eidolon has Fast Healing 2.
        -   Sense: the Eidolon gains the benefit of one of your Senses.
            (e.g. if you have Magesight, then you may give the Eidolon
            Mage Sight.)
        -   Size: the Eidolon is Size Medium.
        -   Sturdy: the Eidolon has +10 DUR and +5 STR.
        -   Wings: the Eidolon has wings; it gains the following
            movement mode: Fly (5/15)

-   Enhanced Eidolon

    -   Requires: Eidolon, 20 Ranks in Spellcraft
    -   Effect: you have more Bonuses available. You can select from the
        following list, as well as the Bonus list above:

        -   Ethereal: the Eidolon can become intangible for short
            periods of time. It gains the following Power:

            -   Action: Quick Action
            -   Effect: the Eidolon becomes intangible. Until its next
                turn, it can pass straight through solid objects, and
                solid objects will pass through it. This means it cannot
                be damaged by weapons, but it also means that it cannot
                (practically) attack other Creatures, or interact with
                objects.

        -   Fire: a fire simmers within the Eidolon, and it can flare
            forth. The fire provides illumination like a torch. The
            Eidolon also gains the following Power:

            -   Action: Sustained
            -   Effect: the Eidolon flares forth, becoming a creature of
                flame. Anything in contact with it suffers 1D10 damage.
                Its natural attacks gain the Fire tag, and cause an
                additional 1D10 DV.

        -   Frost: the Eidolon is suffused with frost, appearing to be
            made from chipped ice. The Eidolon gains +2 Armor and +5
            DUR, and it gains the following Power:

            -   Action: Standard
            -   Effect: the Eidolon can freeze something that it
                touches. Treat this as a Touch-Only Attack. If it hits,
                the target suffers 1D10 DV.

        -   Spines: the Eidolon can launch spines, giving it a potent
            ranged attack. It gains the following attack:

            -   Attack: Projectile Weapons, 1D10+DB, AP -4. Tags:
                Natural Weapon. Range: 20m/30m/40m

-   Eidolons:

    -   Requires: Eidolon
    -   Effect: When you activate the Eidolon power, you can create a
        second Eidolon; if you do, each Eidolon only gets two Bonuses.

-   Fracture

    -   Requires: 10 Ranks in Control
    -   Effect: you can fracture your awareness, so that you can
        maintain multiple "trains of thought" at once.

        -   You gain an extra Standard Action, but you can only use it
            for mental actions.

    -   This power is good in EP, but this isn't EP. Let's just skip
        straight to Imbue.

-   Imbue:

    -   Requires: Fracture, Eidolon, 20 ranks in Control
    -   Requires: Eidolon, 20 ranks in Control
    -   Effect: you can ~~more completely~~ fracture your mind,
        producing a copy of your consciousness for each Eidolon that you
        have.

        -   While sustaining Eidolon, each Eidolon gets its own turn.
            They act on your initiative, after your turn.
        -   It's still your mind controlling them, so you control them,
            and you're aware of what they see and do.

-   Protection

    -   Requires: *Attendant of the Mourner* Class
    -   Action: Sustained
    -   Effect: You gain +3 armor, and those you choose within 5m of you
        gain +2 armor.

[]{#anchor-90}Items
===================

Items come in three categories, *minor*, *normal *and* major*. This
mainly determines their cost when purchased at character creation. A
*minor *item is one useful piece of gear, like a grappling-hook or
ladder (if you just want a ladder, you can pay 1 CP and get a ladder). A
medium item is a useful, notable item -- any one weapon or piece of
armor would be a medium item, or a skill kit (see below). Finally, a
Major item plays a major roll in defining a character; this might
include a magic weapon, an heirloom, a shop or a plot of land.

We don\'t have particular *magic item* rules; like powers, major items
are intended to be worked out between the GM and the player.

It\'s worth noting that this game is intended to be less gear-focused
than other fantasy adventure games (that is, for example, D&D). The
intent is that a character is mostly defined by their Skills first, and
there-after by their Traits, Race, Backgrounds, Classes and Powers.

Some items have keywords. Most of these keywords do not have affects
themselves, but do interact with traits, powers and other rules.

Several of these items are heavy or cumbersome. Rather than attempting
to track item weight in detail, items that are particularly bulky are
given the *Heavy* keyword. To determine how many *Heavy* items a
character can carry without penalty, divide their STR by 10 and round
down. For every additional *Heavy* item beyond this number, the
character suffers a -10 penalty to all physical actions. Other affects
(such as fatigue or immobility) may be applied at GM discretion.

[]{#anchor-93}Magic Items
-------------------------

-   Common Magic Items:

    -   Light: this small glass vile contains a clear liquid. When
        shaken, it produces a bright light: it shines brightly enough
        that a character holding it can see clearly for 20m around them.
        Once it is lit, it will continue to shine until it is shaken
        again, which deactivates it.
    -   Safe-Fall Cape: this cape billows outward as you fall, and both
        it's physical size and magical effects cooperate to slow your
        fall. No matter how far you fall, the cape will prevent you from
        falling faster than a quick run. When you land, you must make an
        athletics check: if you succeed, you take no damage, but if you
        fail, you take 1d10 dv.
    -   Torque of Speaking: you may use one additional language group
        (pick one when purchasing this item).

        -   Note that the torque is giving you access to a language
            group, and not ranks in a specific language. If you're a
            human, you can use a torque to make the sounds needed to
            speak Gnollish (in the language-group GR), but you'd still
            need to have ranks in Language: Heartland Gnoll to actually
            speak it.

    -   Wand:

        -   Attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1d10-2 Damage, Ignores Armor.

            -   Range: 30m (short) / 50m / 70m
            -   Requires 10 ranks in Spellcraft to use (no check is
                required)

        -   Is this potentially fun or stupid?

[]{#anchor-94}Alchemical Items (Drugs, Poisons, Potions and Bombs)
------------------------------------------------------------------

-   I might want to lay out explicit rules for chemicals, either here or
    somewhere else.

    -   I might add Splash as an alternative to Blast, and then separate
        the rules for f.ex. Tar the chemical from using it as a grenade.
    -   On the other hand, how many times will I do that? Is there a
        third one, besides Scour and Tar?

-   Minor

    -   Stim: +2 INIT. Duration: one hour
    -   Healing: regain 1 DUR / Day, +10 on checks made to resist
        disease. Duration: 1 Day
    -   Numbing: negate one wound, -2 Init
    -   Shrooms!: +5 INT, -5 COO, -5 REF. Duration: one hour.
    -   Meth!: +5 REF, -5 INT, -5 WIL. +10 to task actions, but cannot
        make passive checks. Duration: one hour.
    -   Grenade (Grenade):

        -   Attack: thrown, 2D10 DV
        -   Tags: Burst and Fire

    -   Cocktail (Grenade):

        -   Attack: thrown, 1D10+2DV
        -   Tags: Burst and Fire
        -   When it lands, anything in the Burst is covered in burning
            liguid, and set on fire.
        -   Will continue to burn for 10 minutes, doing 1d10+2DV to
            anything covered by the liquid, or in the burning area.
        -   A character who is covered by the liquid may extinguish
            themselves as a Standard Action; they must stop, drop and
            roll to do this, and so they wind up prone afterwards.

    -   Smoke:

        -   Attack: Thrown Weapon
        -   Tags: Burst and Smoke
        -   Produces a cloud of smoke, with a radius of 1D10+3m and
            centered where the Smoke landed.
        -   Creatures in the cloud are obscured; they have Cover (see
            Combat)

-   Medium

    -   Healing (Potion): regain 1 DUR / Hour; regain 1 Wound / 12
        Hours, after all DUR is healed. Duration: 12 hours.

        -   Tags: Magical

    -   Monster (Potion): Gain +10 DUR and +10 STR (this adjusts your
        WT, DR and DB). However, you also take -10 SAV.

        -   Tags: Magical

    -   Scour (Chemical):

        -   Scour is highly caustic; it will dissolve most solid
            objects, and will cause terrible chemical burns to flesh and
            bone.
        -   If used to cover a solid object, that object will take
            1d10+3DV per turn.
        -   If used to cover a character, then that character sustains
            2d10DV per turn.
        -   Fortunately, Scour dissolves in water, making it very easy
            to wash off (if water is available).
        -   If ingested, Scour is lethal, dealing 3D10DV a turn until
            the character dies; fortunately, it is visually distinct
            (being a pale, greenish paste), and the taste is obvious
            (and *horrible*).
        -   Scour doesn't dissolve glass; therefore, a bottle of it can
            be thrown.

            -   Attack: Thrown Weapon, Splash 1D10÷2m
            -   Tags: Splash, Caustic
            -   Anything in the Splash is covered in Scour.

    -   Tar (Chemical): this viscous and sticky substance is highly
        flammable; though it doesn't burn as hot as the mix of alcohol
        and water used in a Cocktail, it burns much longer and is very
        difficult to either remove or extinguish (pouring water on it
        will do neither).

        -   Being covered in Tar is unpleasant, but not immediately
            dangerous; unlike actual tar, it doesn't harden.
        -   Tar is very flammable, however; burning Tar deals 1D10DV per
            turn to anything in contact with it.
        -   Tar is very difficult to extinguish. Dropping and rolling
            will not extinguish it.
        -   Tar is often prepared in a glass or clay container with a
            lit wick, creating a device like a Cocktail:

            -   Attack: Thrown Weapon, Splash, 1D10m
            -   Tags: Splash, Fire
            -   Anything in the splash is covered in burning Tar.

[]{#anchor-95}Skill Kits and Shops
----------------------------------

-   associated with a specific skill

    -   some skills can\'t be practiced *without* a skill kit

-   have the tools useful to perform that skill
-   Note: when you buy a skill kit, you may specify three Minor items
    that the kit definitely contains.

    -   You don\'t have to do this, but it can be useful for declaring
        that you *definitely* have a specific item
    -   for example, with a Craft: Blacksmithing kit, you might specify
        that it *definitely* contains a blacksmithing hammer.

-   Shops are more extensive facilities; they function like Skill Kits,
    but they allow users to pursue larger or longer-term projects. Shops
    provide a +10 on the linked skill.

[]{#anchor-96}Acquiring Items
-----------------------------

-   Acquiring items

    -   several different ways to acquire items. Two major ones have
        specific rules: Bartering for goods, and paying for them with
        Currency

-   Bartering:

    -   Use Trade Goods

        -   Trade goods are either Minor, Moderate or Major. (This is
            also their item category, as above).* *At any given time,
            your Trade Goods can be *depleted* or not (that is, they can
            have the *depleted* tag or not).

    -   When you barter for an item, roll Barter.

        -   You must have some Trade Goods to offer, and the Trade Goods
            you use cannot be *depleted*.
        -   On a Success, you receive the item, and your Trade Goods
            become depleted.
        -   On an Exceptional Success, you receive the item, but your
            Trade Goods do not become depleted
        -   On a Failure, you do not receive the item (and nothing
            happens to your Trade Goods)

    -   Bonuses

        -   you receive a +10 bonus for each category by which your
            Trade Goods exceed the category of the item you're after
        -   You receive a -10 penalty for each category by which the
            item exceeds your Trade Goods

    -   Restoring Trade Goods

        -   you may replenish your Trade Goods (that is, remove the
            *depleted* tag) with a successful Profession check. This is
            a Job with:

            -   a one Shift time-frame for Minor Trade Goods
            -   a five Shift time-frame and a -10 modifier for Moderate
                Trade Goods
            -   a 25 Shift time-frame and a -20 modifier for Major Trade
                Goods

    -   Creating Trade Goods

        -   you can create Trade Goods using a Profession skill.
            Creating Trade Goods is a Job that:

            -   has a 5 Shift time-frame for Minor Trade Goods
            -   has a 25 Shift time-frame and a -10 modifier for
                Moderaate Trade Goods
            -   has a 200 Shift time-frame and a -20 modifier for Major
                Trade Goods

-   Paying for items with Currency

    -   Currency is measured in Copper Pieces
    -   GM will determine prices, with the following as a guide:

        -   Minor: 5 copper
        -   Moderate: 100 copper
        -   Major: 1,000 copper

[]{#anchor-97}Creating Items
----------------------------

-   Characters can use their Craft skills to create items directly.

    -   This requires an appropriate *skill kit* and raw materials to
        work with.
    -   This requires the character succeed on an appropriate Craft
        check.

        -   Creating a *Significant Magic Item* also requires a
            Spellcraft check.

-   Time Frames at GM's discretion, with the following guidelines:

    -   Minor Item: two hour Task Action
    -   Moderate Item: ~~one day~~ 1 shift Job
    -   Major Item: ~~one month~~ 25 shift Job

-   Raw Materials

    -   Characters need raw materials to make things---but how do you
        determine if characters have raw materials? There isn't a Raw
        Materials item, and there aren't rules for it.
    -   Our answer is: assume they have raw materials, unless there's a
        very good reason that they don't.

        -   For example, if they've had to flee their homes at short
            notice, if they've been traveling light for days, or if
            they've been captured.

    -   If GMs (or players) want a more definite system for tracking raw
        materials, see Raw Materials in Optional Rules.

[]{#anchor-98}Building Characters
=================================

The rules for Renaissance are very free-form; some people really enjoy
that, but some people can get lost with all the options they have. The
following is intended as a guide, to give players looking for a
foot-hold how to design, build and play their characters. These are not
rules, but guidelines; your own judgement will apply, as will your
desires for your character and the GM's assessment of the situation.

[]{#anchor-99}General Tips
--------------------------

-   Renaissance is a diverse game

    -   D&D focuses on combat; that's where most of the rules and
        abilities go, and most of the game time is.
    -   Renaissance is more diverse.
    -   Combat, Social Scenes, Stealth, Crafting and Analysis are all
        balanced equally; so, for example, you'll only spend 1/5 of your
        time in Combat.
    -   As a *very* general rule, characters should be *excellent* at
        one of those things, and *good *at two others.

-   Characters should be Great in one area and Good in several.

    -   Not too focused! New players are often tempted to hyper-focus,
        getting 120 in like 3 related skills; this doesn't work,
        because a) you can still roll a 21 and get beaten by a 34,
        and b) you'll have nothing to do most of the time.
    -   Not too spread out! Getting 50-ish ratings in lots of skills can
        be unrewarding, because there's nothing you're really great at;
        when the pressure is on, the negative modifiers stack up and you
        can't try again, you won't be able to do anything with a base
        rating of 50.
    -   Usually 2 skills over 70, 4 skills over 60 and 4 more skills
        over 50 is a pretty good balance.
    -   Get skills from diverse areas.

[]{#anchor-100}Character Archetypes
-----------------------------------

-   Archetypes are broad character concepts.
-   They generally refer to packages of skills, powers, classes and
    items that fit together.

-   Stealth:

    -   Using powers like Sneak Attack, you can be effective at dealing
        damage, but Stealth characters often fare poorly in a stand-up
        fight.
    -   Plays:

        -   Sneaking into somewhere will likely be handled as an
            Infiltration vs. Perception test; be aware that some senses
            (like Scent) will make this much harder, or impossible.
        -   Tailing someone who isn't looking out for you will likely
            require one check, your Infiltration vs. their (passive)
            Perception.

-   Combat

    -   Combat is very deadly, by design! Damage is high and Wounds
        debilitate you quickly even if you don't die.
    -   Healing is also hard, also by design---and "in combat" healing
        is a practical impossibility. One of the best healing abilities
        in the game, Heal, gives you Fast Healing 2; Binding a Wound is
        a 10 Minute Task Action that only might work (and you only get
        to try once per wound).
    -   It's supposed to be this way. The idea is that combat should be
        rough on both sides, and even the winners should spend time
        after patching themselves up.
    -   At least one high attack skill is obvious.
    -   High Fray and good armor are very wise investments if you want
        to win (or survive) combat.
    -   Also, having a plan for the after-combat "patching the team
        together" moment is a good idea.

        -   The various Heal related powers are good, as are ranks in
            Medicine.
        -   Potions are useful, but longer-term; healing happens slowly,
            and it can take days or even weeks to fully recover.

    -   To make combat fun, on the other hand, a good weapon (a
        Significant Magic Item, probably) and some fun powers are
        recommended.

        -   Who doesn't enjoy a magical exploding hammer or a golem arm?

    -   It applies to everyone, but it applies especially to combat
        characters; remember that you'll only be in combat 20% of the
        time or so, and it's a very good idea to have other things you
        can do. Skills like Knowledge: History \[Military History\],
        Profession: Soldier, Craft: Smithing, Craft: Chemistry (soldiers
        use potions and poisons, after all), Intimidate, Athletics and
        Protocol are all character-appropriate investments.
    -   Aimed Shots can be very useful if you have a very high Attack
        skill. If your target number is over 90 after everything is
        added together, then you can easily absorb a -10 penalty in the
        name of having a chance to cut off a hand or gouge out an eye.

-   Magic-User

    -   Magic-heavy characters can be very powerful and very flexible.
    -   The abilities of Mages and Psions are easy to represent
        mechanically; simple take high ranks in Spellcraft or Control
        (or both), and take appropriate powers.
    -   Clerics are a little trickier: Boons can be represented as
        granted powers or magical items (presumably granted by a
        spirit), but in general, the abilities of Clerics will be
        represented more "narratively." Which is to say, wheras Mages
        and Psions will primarily represent their magical abilities with
        powers, Clerics will have to actually haggle with spirits---a
        process that has no specific rules, and is accomplished by
        roll-playing through it. See "dealing with a spirit" in Common
        Scenes.
    -   While having a high Control or Spellcraft can be useful,
        remember that not every power requires a Control or Spellcraft
        check---or a check at all, for that matter. Fireball doesn't
        require a check to manifest, and it requires a Thrown Weapons
        check to throw it!

-   Social Butterfly

    -   Remember that, in Renaissance, the player is expected to be
        proactive with checks. The GM will not always prompt you, "you
        can make a Read check now," rather it is your responsibility to
        say, "I'd like to roll Read to see if I think he's lying." (If
        you don't, then the GM may roll your Read for you, as a passive
        check---that is, with a penalty.)
    -   Protocol's use might not be immediately obvious; it lets you
        handle the social norms and expectations of a situation.

        -   It can be useful while *preparing* for a social scene;
            Protocol can be used to determine what is expected of you.
        -   Protocol can also be useful for *recovering gracefully* from
            an error; if you make a mistake, one your character never
            would have, a Protocol roll can play it off as a joke, or
            simple error, or otherwise make it seem trivial.

    -   Barter is a little bit of an oddity; it's a social skill that
        isn't normally used in roll-playing. It's used in very specific
        circumstances: specifically, when buying or selling goods.

-   Crafter

    -   Crafters can produce things that the party needs.
    -   Crafters have two major limits: they can only provide the party
        things that they know how to produce---that is, things they have
        the craft skills for---and crafting items can take time.
    -   If you have Spellcraft and Craft: Smithing, then, during
        down-time, you can just take a month and build a magical hammer.
        But that takes raw materials and a month: if you're in the
        middle of exploring an abandoned monastery, you can't just
        produce a hammer.
    -   Remember to buy a skill kit---you need to have tools to make
        things!
    -   The rules for crafting say that you need "raw materials," but
        don't provide a price for that; that's because we don't attempt
        to track how much raw materials cost or how much they weigh,
        across all the things that "raw materials" might mean. In
        general, if you are working in a well-stocked Shop, Raw
        Materials can be assumed; if you aren't---for example, if you
        don't own a shop, or are traveling lightly---you will need to
        purchase them. (Cost Minor is a good cost for raw materials,
        enough for several Minor items or one Moderate one. Major items,
        meanwhile, might require unique components, that must be tracked
        specifically.)

-   Scholar

    -   Scholars are characters who *know things*. This can be very
        important in Renaissance, as an adventure might turn on being
        able to answer any of the following questions: what really
        happened 300 years ago (Knowledge: History), what might appease
        an angered spirit (Knowledge: Theology or Profession: Cleric),
        could the Commonwealth Army breach this fortification
        (Profession: Soldier), which noble line in the Eastern Kingdom
        was this knight loyal too (Knowledge: Noble Lineages).
    -   Many adventures have an *investigation phase---*the party starts
        not knowing what's going on, but having clues, and are then
        required to gather more evidence and figure out what's going on.
        Scholars are the characters who take those clues and *figure out
        what's going on*.
    -   Scholars often also need Research. No one character knows
        everything, you'll frequently have to *hit the books*.
    -   Profession is also a knowledge skill; it represents knowing how
        a given field works. Profession: Soldier \[Command\] can be used
        to for military knowledge, for example, while Profession:
        Smuggler can be used to know how to smuggle items into or out of
        a city, or how to make a criminal contact
    -   There are hopelessly many different areas of knowledge,
        especially considering all the different possible Interest and
        Profession skills that could exist. While the Scholar class can
        help with that, in general, the roll of "knowing things" needs
        to be spread across several different characters.

-   Backer

    -   in a broad sense, referring to the rich trader or noble who can
        bank-roll the party.

        -   One of the neat things about this game, IMO, is that this
            can be a player roll.

    -   Similar to a crafter, their job is to provide the party with the
        things that they need. However, they do this by simply *buying*
        it.
    -   On the up-side, buying something is fast; you can buy a sword
        much quicker than you can make it.
    -   On the down side, you can't always buy things: if you find an
        abandoned alchemist's lab, a chemist could make something, but
        you can't buy potions from it.
    -   People with wealth and assets can also get noble audiences, hire
        help, or bribe guards, all of which can be very useful.
    -   It's a good idea to get several Trade Goods; any given trade can
        deplete one of them, so having more than one handy is useful.
    -   Replenishing your Trade Goods is a good use of your Down Time.
    -   Backer-type characters can also make good use of classes like
        Noble or General; you can use your title to get access to people
        who might not be available to the Common Folk.

        -   Noble is a good choice for a Backer/Socialite, and General
            is a good choice for a Backer/Fighter.

    -   Playing a Backer who operates using criminal connections can be
        very interesting; such connections can be very powerful, as they
        can net you services (like assassins) and goods (like black-mail
        information) that can't be acquired any other way.

        -   However, the consequences of being discovered could also be
            dire, and anything you acquire might come with strings
            attached---both situations good for roll-playing!
        -   Profession: Smuggler will be an important skill for such a
            character.
        -   This is a good choice for Backer/Stealth characters.

[]{#anchor-101}Common Scenes
----------------------------

-   "Standard Operating Procedures" for several common scenes.

    -   These are especially not rules: the GM will adjust as
        appropriate.

-   Making Camp

    -   Consume rations; remember to mark them down.
    -   Heal up; declare who's doing what to achieve that.
    -   Keep watch: usually use two 4-hour watches.

        -   Players who don't get enough sleep will eventually begin to
            suffer penalties.
        -   Keep Senses and Perception skill in mind when selecting
            watch.

-   Summoning a Spirit

    -   Remember that spirits are *wildly* diverse; each area has its
        own spirits, no two of which will operate by exactly the same
        rules.
    -   (Although there are also some very powerful spirits with very
        large basins; a Spirit associated with a mountain range might be
        known throughout, while each area of the range will have its own
        local, unique spirits.)
    -   Remember that Spirits won't cooperate with you just because you
        summoned them: make sure there's some reason that the Spirit in
        question will actually do anything for you. Think about some
        reason that your interests align with its, or make sure there's
        some propetiation you can make that it will want, or make sure
        you can bind it.
    -   Remember also that Spirits are very powerful; they can offer
        powefull, game-changing boons, but an uncooperative spirit can
        also cause a *lot* of damage. Summoning a spirit is a good thing
        to do carefully, taking your time and spending Luck Points on.

        -   Screwing up a Bind can be *particularly* bad.

    -   Step 1: Research Local Spirits

        -   if you aren't a priest in the area, you probably don't know
            how the local spirits operate; even if you are, checking the
            library for any "gotchase" is wise.
        -   Probably an 8 hour Task Action, requiring a Research check,
            with Knowledge: Theology, Profession: Cleric, Profession:
            Shaman or similar as a related skill.

    -   Step 2: Design the Ritual

        -   a 4 hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Cleric,
            Profession: Shaman or similar check.
        -   Knowledge: Theology is a related skill, and an Exceptional
            or Critical Success on your Research test may help.

    -   Step 3: Perform the Ritual

        -   a one hour Task Action, requiring a Profession: Cleric,
            Profession: Shaman or similar check.

    -   Step 4: Haggle!

        -   Once summoned---assuming it was summoned correctly---you can
            now bargain with the spirit. This is done in-character,
            using your social skills.

-   Researching a Clue

    -   Many times, you'll need access to information that you simply
        don't have; you might need to know the history of one particular
        noble line, or the bind for one particular spirit.
    -   Libraries exist throughout the Commonwealth, both public and
        private; one simple recourse is to simply look the information
        up.
    -   With access to a library, you can research some particular topic
        with a 6 hour Task Action requiring a Research test; if you
        succeed, you gain useful information about the topic.
    -   The quality of the library can complicate things; large
        libraries whose collections span many topics might take longer
        to search, while small or disorganized collections might apply a
        penalty.
    -   And, of course, there's a chance that the information you want
        simply won't be written down---maybe not in the library you're
        searching, maybe not anywhere.

        -   An appropriate Knowledge check can be used to guess where
            (or whether) you can find the information you're after, as
            can an appropriate Profession check.

    -   After you've accumulated some useful information, you still need
        to *analyze* it; this is handled as a two-hour Task Action,
        requiring an appropriate Knowledge check.

-   Asking Around Town

    -   Sometimes, you need information; you might need rumors, gossip,
        or just basic information about an unfamiliar town.
    -   You can "ask around town" as a four hour Task Action, requiring
        a Protocol check; if you succeed, you might be rewarded with
        some basic information, or you might meet some interesting NPC
        (who might be willing to answer questions, might exchange
        information for coin, or might turn out to be important to the
        quest).
    -   This procedure isn't subtle; there's a good chance people will
        remember "the one stranger snooping around".

        -   You can take a -20 penalty on your Protocol check to be
            discreet.
        -   Of course, a good disguise might prevent this from being a
            problem all-together---unless you're a member of a very rare
            race, or otherwise difficult to disguise.

    -   You can make a Read check to gauge the trustworthiness of the
        people you've gathered information from.
    -   You can make a Deception check to attempt to conceal your true
        motives and interests.

-   Getting an Audience

    -   Those with connections can get the party in to see powerful and
        useful contacts---they can get audiences with nobles, generals
        or wealthy people of business.
    -   How you go about setting up a meeting depends on the particulars
        of who you want to meet with: a Protocol check can be used to
        make a guess about whether or not a given person will meet with
        you, how you can go about setting that up, and what kind of
        leverage with them you might have.

        -   Related skills like Interest: Noble Lines or Profession:
            City Administrator might help.
        -   If you're new in town, you might not have enough information
            to make the check; you might need to *ask around town
            *first, as above.

    -   The procedure for setting up a meeting might vary: you might be
        able to walk into the contact's estate and ask to be announced,
        you might have to arrange a clandestine meeting, or you might
        not be able to arrange an appointment at all.

-   Getting an Illegal Item

    -   Able smugglers can use Profession: Smuggler to acquire things
        the party wants---common items, illegal items, the "services" of
        an assassin, information\...
    -   As a rough guide, you can work the docks and alleyways of a
        large town in search of someone with a valuable commodity as a 2
        Hour Task-Action requiring a Profession: Smuggler test (or
        similar).
    -   If you succeed, you locate someone who has the thing you're
        after.
    -   You still have to pay for the item as normal (using Barter with
        either Trade Goods or money).
    -   This can be dangerous: on a critical failure, you might run
        afoul of local law enforcement---or some other powerful enemy.

[]{#anchor-102}Running Games
============================

[]{#anchor-103}Designing Adventures
-----------------------------------

-   See the notes in the Common Scenes section.
-   Remember that Renaissance is supposed to be balanced between several
    different areas---acquiring resources, fighting, sneaking, social
    scenes and analysis. Don't let any one of these become too large.
-   Individual adventures are often short.
-   Long "arcs" can be broken into *chapters*, where a chapter
    represents a single, contained adventure.

    -   Chapters can take anywhere between 4-12 sessions, and usually
        represent between 3 and 14 days in the game world.

-   Separate chapters with stretches of *down time*.

    -   This is important: healing is hard, and psychological healing is
        *very* hard; your players will need plenty of time between
        chapters to rest and recuperate.
    -   This is also when players will recharge their Trade Goods,
        crafters will make things, and players will pursue their
        projects (like building businesses, or crewing ships, or
        developing new powers).

-   An individual chapter---whether a self-contained adventure or a
    component of a longer arc---should include an even balance of
    elements.

    -   A common pattern is to start by handing players a mission or a
        clue; then, the early part of the adventure is often
        investigating, find people of interest and figuring out what's
        going on.

-   Remember that climactic events in Renaissance don't need to be
    fights.

    -   They *can* be, but they don't *need* to be.
    -   Nothing is wrong with having the ultimate enemy be a deeply evil
        noble who is useless in a fight.

-   Problems should have diverse solutions.

    -   Make sure there are multiple ways to solve any given problem, so
        that different characters with different skillsets can all be
        active and useful.
    -   Embrace solutions to problems that aren't fighting.
    -   If you have a Backer-type character, be sure to allow them to
        occasionally simply use their money or prestige to escape
        trouble and solve problems.

        -   (This is worth being specific about because the kinds of
            solutions that Backer-type characters will come up with are
            likely to be the kinds of solutions that GMs would work
            really hard to disallow in a D&D game.)

-   Renaissance chapters can lean on background and setting a lot more
    than D&D games do.

    -   This is partly because Renaissance has a lot more non-combat
        than D&D, but
    -   it's also because Renaissance enemies tend to be Spirits, with
        cinematic (rather than mechanical) powers.
    -   You'll need to have a good enough idea of what the world that
        the players are in should be like, and what kind of resources
        should be available to them, that they can explore it,
        investigate, ask questions and talk to people.

-   Evil Spirits make good ultimate villains.

    -   Remember, powerful Spirits should be handled "cinematically," as
        opposed to mechanically. Don't "stat-out the gods."
    -   Defeating Spirits might hinge on having specific magical
        implements, or knowledge of specific rituals---or the backing of
        *other* powerful spirits. The campaign might turn on acquiring
        these resources.
    -   (When this is true, it's good to hint to your players that they
        have no chance of defeating a given spirit in a fight, and need
        to look for other options.)
    -   Spirits should also be *menacing* and *strange*:

        -   menacing in the sense that they are vastly more powerful
            than the characters, and might be extremely dangerous---and
            the characters might be helpless if the spirit decides to
            turn on them, which it might do for no other reason than it
            wants to.
        -   Strange in the sense that mortals may no nothing at all
            about the intent or nature of a given spirit, and its plans,
            objectives and behaviors might be completely obscured to
            lesser beings.

-   Rewards

    -   Money, Trade Goods, valuables (like land) and favors the rich
        and powerful all make good rewards; these can be good fuel for
        roll-playing, and can be very useful to PCs during Down Time
        (and future adventures).
    -   Specific magical items make very *poor* rewards. Remember that
        Renaissance is designed around having a small number of
        interesting features---that is, powers and items.

        -   If you give a player an item that they didn't ask for, they
            might not find it *interesting*; it might become the least
            of several options the player has available.
        -   Remember that players should be the primary authors of their
            features; if they want a power or weapon, *they* should be
            the ones to come up with it.
        -   Realize that players can just make their own features; a
            crafter can make any magical weapon or armor that they want
            during down-time, and a spellcaster (or psion or fighter or
            cleric) can make a new power. Why give them an item they may
            not be interested in, when they can just make their own
            during the next Down Time?

    -   If you feel that you must give your PCs magical "power toys,"
        then *potions* make good rewards.

        -   Potions can have a range of magical effects, which can be
            both powerful and interesting.
        -   Because they are expensive and single-use, players might not
            invest resources in stock-piling them.
        -   It might be tricky to come up with specific effects, that
            are interesting without being overpowered (or useless).
        -   Again, tho, remember that you shouldn't reward them with a
            potion that a character with 50 ranks in Craft: Alchemy
            couldn't just make.

-   Enemies

    -   One of the down-sides of being mostly defined by skills is that
        enemies can seem generic.
    -   Interesting items and powers can go a long way towards making an
        enemy seem *unique*.
    -   Sometimes just being an interesting race or employing an
        interesting tactic can help make an individual enemy stand out.

### []{#anchor-107}Chasseh Forrest Spirit

The spirits that dwell in the woods south of the human town of Chasseh
have the ability to take control of the wildlife that is native to their
forest; these spirits are mercurial, and not particularly friendly;
though they can be bargained with, they are typically somewhere between
unhelpful and dangerous.

A possessed animal uses the animal's stats, but gains the Aptitudes,
Skill Ranks and Powers from the spirit. You may assign Aptitude Bonuses
appropriate to the creature, +10 to one Aptitude and +5 to another.

If the animal is killed, the spirit simply departs from it, flee into
the forrests.

### []{#anchor-109}Cougar

These big cats are flexible predators, able to persist from the snowy
north to the humid south. They are solitary and territorial. They
usually hunt by ambush. Though dangerous, they can be backed off of prey

### []{#anchor-111}Kambi

These small, furred, yapping creatures have a rudimentary intelligence;
they tend to live in simple, hierarchal social groups, and can build
simple "languages" with as many as 100 sounds and concepts. Attempts to
integrate them into Commonwealth society have failed; they are usually
managed as pests, and occasionally kept as pets.

Background may need tweaking; I want this to be funny, not dark.

  ---------- ----- ------ ----- ---------- ----- -----

-   Movement: Walking 4/12
-   Senses: Normal, Scent
-   Tags: Humanoid, Kambi, Wild Companion
-   Mindlessly Brave: Kambis have almost no instinct for
    self-preservation. On the plus side, this means that it is almost
    impossible to frighten them; on the minus side, this means that
    Kambis can fail to avoid even obvious hazards, blithely walking into
    danger and destruction.

    -   Kambis automatically pass tests to resist fear.
    -   Kambis have the Oblivious trait. Work on this.

-   Trainable: Kambis have a basic ability to learn and to use tools.

    -   Kambis can have up to 30 ranks in skills, in addition to those
        listed here.
    -   "Wild" Kambi societies will typically be trained in combat
        skills.
    -   "Domesticated" Kambis can be trained in diverse skills. (10
        points in a language is recommended.)

-   Almost Social: Kambis can be influenced by either Handle Animal or
    Persuasion.
-   Skills:

    -   *Chase* 50
    -   Cooking 40
    -   Fray 40
    -   Intimidate 30
    -   Perception 40
    -   Stealth 40
    -   One Melee skill at 50

-   Items:

    -   "wild" Kambis will have simple armor (1 Armor) and a simple
        weapon (a knife, "sword" or spear).

### []{#anchor-112}Raccoon

These small, intelligent omnivores have dexterous hands and a highly
developed sense of touch; they can be very difficult to manage, as they
can open bottles, jars, doors and simple locks. Though they can live in
many environments, they prefer those that afford them trees to hide in,
and streams where they can forage for (and wash) food.

    perceive and manipulate small objects by touch alone; they can even
    defeat simple locks purely by touch, without needing to see them.
    Raccoons receive a +20 bonus to Perception tests involving touch.

### []{#anchor-113}Raptor

At first glance, these large, heavily-feathered predators might appear
to be birds. Their large, clawed, three-fingered hands might appear to
be wings, and can allow the creature to glide for short distances; their
large, powerful legs allow them to sprint and pounce; each foot has a
large, sickle-shaped claw on one toe, allowing them to grip and restrain
prey; and their long, articulated tails provide stability while
sprinting, leaping and gliding.

Raptors are common on *the Southern continent,* where there are many
different species present, fitting a variety of different sizes, diets
and behaviors; some are larger, and hunt mainly by pouncing and pinning
live pray, while others are smaller, can fly, and hunt small animals and
insects. The one presented here is a medium-sized creature known as a
*get Acier to give us a name*; they operate in small packs, and hunt
smaller prey by pursuit or ambush.

[]{#anchor-117}Building Creatures
---------------------------------

[]{#anchor-118}Alternate Rules
==============================

The following are alternate rules systems. Some of them might be ideas
that I'm playing with for future inclusion, while others might just be
common systems that most people would house-rule in if we didn't cover
them. Some are just good rules that we didn't think fit in the core
rules, for one reason or another.

[]{#anchor-119}Buying Back Negative Traits
------------------------------------------

-   Sometimes a player might want to remove a negative trait that
    they've acquired.

    -   Maybe a negative trait they selected during character creation
        is turning out to be more of a hassle than they thought it
        would, or
    -   maybe they acquired the trait during play and want to get rid of
        it (who wants to be Wanted forever?).

-   Using these rules, when a character is spending rez, they may spend
    an amount of Rez equal to the CP bonus from a negative trait to "buy
    it off"---that is, remove it.
-   Optionally, the GM can rule that some negative traits cannot simply
    be bought off, but might require some in-character action.

    -   Buying back the Wanted trait, for example, might be an
        interesting adventure in itself.
    -   Of course, when this happens, the GM should lower the cost in
        Rez to buy the trait off (potentially even all the way to 0).
        This essentially represents giving the character credit for the
        extra work that they're doing.

[]{#anchor-120}Creating Advantage
---------------------------------

-   This alternate rule represents a system for using one skill to help
    out with another

    -   it replaces the Related Skill and Assisting Characters bonuses.

-   Characters can attempt to create advantage for an upcoming check,
    called the Primary Check.
-   To create an advantage, a character picks a skill that could be used
    to help---usually a skill that could be a related skill, or that
    could be used to assist. They then roll a Simple Check: if they
    succeed, then the primary check has *advantage.*
-   If a character has advantage on a test, then they select on effect
    that they would normally spend a Luck Point for, and again that
    benefit.
-   A character can potentially create advantage for themselves, or for
    other characters.

-   For example, suppose you'd like to sit in a market and listen for
    local gossip, but you want to do so without attracting attention.
    This is naturally a Stealth test, since you're trying to "blend in."
    But, if you're a social character, you might not have a good Stealth
    rating.

    -   With the normal rules, you might ask the GM if you can use your
        Protocol as a related skill---representing you using your
        knowledge of social norms to be inconspicuous.

-   The test that you would like to create an advantage for is the
    *primary test*, and the skill that you would like to use to create
    that advantage is the *secondary skill*.
-   To create advantage, before making the primary test, make a Simple
    Success Check using the secondary skill; if you excel, you gain
    *advantage* on the primary test.
-   If you have *advantage* on a test, you may select one effect that
    you would normally spend a Luck Point for, and gain that benefit.
    (So you could choose to remove all negative modifiers, for example.)

    -   You still have to follow the restrictions about when you can
        spend a luck point. For example, you can't decide before you
        roll that you'd like to flip your result, and you can't decide
        after you roll that you'd like to remove all negative modifiers.

-   Sometimes, creating advantage doesn't require a discrete action; if
    you're using your Academics: Alchemy to help you craft a potion,
    then the Academics: Alchemy secondary skill test isn't a separate
    action from the Task Action to brew the potion.

    -   Someteimes, however, you *can* create advantage as a separate
        action. If you research a noble's family history in a library
        before attempting to arrange a meeting, then you can represent
        that by using a Research test (a Task Action) to create
        advantage on the following Protocol test.

[]{#anchor-121}Fate Points
--------------------------

-   "Borrowed" from Fate.
-   We hate Fate, but hey, other people like it, so for them, there's
    the Fate Points alternative rule.
-   This optional rule adds a new stat: similar to Luck Points,
    characters now have the Fate stat and Fate Points.
-   Each character also receives 1 Fate for free during character
    creation, and they can increase their Fate by 1 for 15 CP.
-   Like Luck, characters begin play with a number of Fate Points equal
    to their Fate stat; over the course of the game, they can gain,
    spend and lose Fate Points, but their Fate state remains the same.
-   Players may spend a Fate Point to do the following:

    -   Specify some useful detail about their surroundings---like a
        window that they can jump through to escape Danger 5, or paint
        they can use to pretend they have clothes on.
    -   Specify some connection they have to an NPC (such as that they
        served in the same regiment).
    -   To avoid dying when reaching their DR (additional damage is
        discarded).

-   GMs may veto a use of a Fate Point if it is absurd, disruptive or
    completely implausible.
-   Any suggestions for rules for gaining and loosing Fate Points?

[]{#anchor-122}Guns
-------------------

-   We don't include guns in the main game, as, if they're done remotely
    realistically, they change the game dramatically.
-   In particular, they're likely to make bows and arrows irrelevant.
-   Still, simple guns (like blunderbusses) are features of many fantasy
    setting and archetypes, so we've decided to provide sample gun rules
    here.
-   Guns are handled using the Projectile Weapons skill.
-   Guns are usually loaded by ramming black powder and a ball or
    canister down the barrel; this is usually a Standard Action.
-   The powder is ruined if it gets wet---although it can be stored in
    water-tight containers. Obviously, guns cannot be fired or loaded
    under water.
-   Once you know how to do it, the chemistry to produce black powder
    isn't particularly difficult. Black powder can be produced with a
    Craft: Chemistry check, with a +10 modifier.
-   10 balls and enough black powder to fire them can be purchased for
    Cost: Low.

-   Blunderbuss

    -   Blunderbusses are short-barreled weapons with fluted ends; they
        aren't particularly accurate, and are usually used to fire
        shot---although they can also be loaded with other projectiles
        as well. Some examples are given below.
    -   Ball: 2d10+4 DV, AP -5
    -   Scatter: 1d10+4 DV, AP -1, splash 3m
    -   Scour Canister: 3m splash, covers targets with Scour.
    -   Range: short 15m / medium 25m / long 35m

-   Dragon

    -   The Dragon is the short, one-handed version of the Blunderbuss.
        It uses lighter loads and smaller projectiles.
    -   Ball: 2d10+2 DV, AP -3
    -   Scatter: 1d10+2 DV, AP -1, splash 3m
    -   Scour Canister: 2m splash, covers targets with Scour.
    -   Range: short 10m / medium 20m / long 30m

-   Musket

    -   A musket is a long-gun that fires a single ball. While their
        wounds are gruesome, they are even more notable for being very
        effective at penetrating armor.
    -   Muskets do 3d10 DV, and have AP -7
    -   Range: short 20m / medium 30m / long 40m / extreme 50m

[]{#anchor-123}Momentum and Threat
----------------------------------

-   Sometimes you score a critical success on a boring and uninteresting
    check; other times, your players score a critical failure on a
    boring and trivial check; and sometimes nobody can think of a good
    critical effect---what does critically succeeding on a test to make
    three dozen spoons even look like?
-   The Star Trek RPG has a great system for this, and we're adding it
    as an optional rule.
-   This rule adds two new *pools*, *momentum* and *complications*.

    -   These pools aren't individual character stats; instead, they're
        shared by the party (in the case of *momentum*) and managed by
        the GM (in the case of *complications*).
    -   So the party has one shared Momentum pool that everyone uses,
        and the GM has one Threat pool that they will draw from.
    -   The GM may choose to let the party see the Threat pool, or to
        keep it secret.

-   Each pool starts at 0, and can be raised as high as the number of
    players, including the GM(s) (so if there are 5 players and 1 GM,
    then each pool can go up to 6).
-   When the players score an exceptional or critical success, they can
    choose to Downgrade. If they do, then they gain (or "bank") one
    Momentum.
-   Likewise, if an (opponent) NPC scores a Critical or Exceptional
    Success, the GM may choose to Downgrade in order to gain (or bank)
    one Threat.
-   If a player scores an Exceptional or Critical Failure, the GM may
    offer to gain one Threat in exchange for allowing the player to
    Upgrade.
-   A player may spend Momentum to:

    -   gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Luck Points;
    -   gain any benefit they could spend a Fate Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Fate Points (if using the Fate Points
        alternate rules);
    -   re-roll a check (at the cost of 2 Momentum);
    -   Deal maximum damage with an attack (at the cost of 2 Momentum).

-   A GM may spend Threat to:

    -   force a player to re-roll a Test;
    -   introduce a new obstacle that hinders the players, such as a
        guard showing up at the wrong time or a petty noble deciding
        they'll spend the rest of the day making the player's lives Hard
        (at the cost of 2 Threat, so make it a good one!);
    -   have one NPC gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for,
        according to the rules for spending Luck Points;
    -   halve the damage inflicted by an attack (at the cost of 2
        Threat)

-   Part of the intent of Momentum and Threat is to give them game a
    more cinematic feel; both GMs and players should bear that in mind
    when banking and spending.
-   How momentum is spent is a party decision, which is to say, we
    provide no guidance for what GMs should do if the party doesn't
    agree on how to spend a Momentum.

    -   If you'd like to turn your gaming table into a Friendship
        Destruction Simulator, you can try allowing any player to spend
        Momentum unilaterally; be prepared for fratricide.

-   If anyone has some other suggestions for ways to spend Momentum,
    that'd be rad.

[]{#anchor-124}Raw Materials
----------------------------

-   The rules for crafting tell you that you need "raw materials" to
    craft, but they (implicitly) leave it up to the GM to determine if
    that's the case.

    -   The following rules allow players to purchase and track their
        use of raw materials, and are useful for GMs who want to make
        resource management a part of their game.

-   You may purchase raw materials for a given Craft skill---for
    example, "Craft: Alchemy Raw Materials"

    -   Raw Materials are Moderate items, and have the Heavy tag.

-   When you purchase Raw Materials, they have 20 charges.

    -   Crafting a Minor item consumes 1 charge.
    -   Crafting a Moderate item consumes 5 charges.
    -   Crafting a Major item consumes 10 charges.
    -   Your raw materials are consumed when they run out of charges.

-   We don't provide rules for "recharging" Raw Materials: when you
    deplete your Raw Materials, you should simply buy more.
-   Note that raw materials, though heavy, are portable.

    -   GMs may rule that some tasks require more resources than raw
        materials provide; for example, Craft: Sculpture raw materials
        might not have enough marble to carve a life-sized statue.
    -   GMs may also rule that Raw Materials just don't make sense for
        some skills; for example, enough marble to build a castle would
        cost more than a Moderate item and be more than Heavy, so Craft:
        Masonry Raw Materials might not be allowed.

[]{#anchor-125}Reactions
------------------------

-   Consider a caster-character standing behind and to the side of a
    fighter-character; with the rules as they are, nothing stops an
    enemy from simply *walking around* the fighter character and
    attacking the caster character.

    -   Reactions provide a framework for taking *reactions* outside of
        your turn, which includes as a primary use-case allowing
        fighter-type characters to attack people who try to move past
        them.
    -   This allows fighter-types to better control an area, and to
        better defend their team-mates.

-   Using these rules, you may sometimes take actions outside of your
    turn.

    -   An action taken outside of your turn is called a *reaction*.
    -   Once you take a reaction, you cannot take *another* reaction
        until the end of your next turn. (Roughly, you only get one
        reaction per turn.)

-   Readied Actions: as a Standard Action, you may *ready* an action: if
    you do, specify another Standard Action, and a condition. If the
    condition occurs before your next turn, you may choose to take the
    specified action.

    -   Activating your a Readied Action is a reaction.

-   Attacks of Opportunity: if a character who you threaten attempts to
    move away from or past you, you may make an attack against them.
    This uses all the normal rules for an attack. This doesn't hinder
    their movement, unless you incapacitate them with your attack (by
    knocking them over for example).

    -   An Attack of Opportunity is a reaction.

[]{#anchor-126}Reputation
-------------------------

-   Characters might be members of guilds, gangs, temples or other
    organizations.

    -   Tracking their rising and falling status within those
        organizations can be interesting fuel for roleplay and
        adventure, and can help people flesh out their characters.
    -   Here are optional rules for tracking character's *reputations*.

-   If you use these rules, your character can have *reputation(s)* with
    one or more *organization*.

    -   For each organization that you are known to, you have a
        reputation score (hereafter, "rep").
    -   "Organization" here is used somewhat loosely: it might be a
        literal organization, like a trade guild, but it might also be a
        town, a gang, a temple, a university, or a secret society---or
        just a group of people.
    -   Your rep score consists of between 1 and 5 "dots".
    -   At one dot, you're a new member, just making your way; at 5
        dots, you are a pillar of the community, widely known and
        greatly respected within the organization.
    -   (There are potentially infinitely many organizations that you
        are not a member of---with which you have 0 dots. We don't track
        those for obvious reasons.)
    -   Each of your reputation scores might also have either the
        *depleted* or *suspended *tag (or both). These will be described
        below.

-   Example Organizations:

    -   a specific temple (rep: Bronze Hills Monastery)
    -   a commonwealth council organization (rep: Commonwealth Navy, rep
        Commonwealth Engineers)
    -   a specific guild (rep: Brier-Treaders Explorer League, rep:
        Heartland Mason's Guild)
    -   a specific university or field of study (rep: Correspondence of
        Heartland Philosophers, rep Haven Isle Astronomical Society)
    -   a group of people (rep: Windward Isle Dock-Hands, rep: Citizenry
        of Kareku Aer)

-   When do I need to buy rep?

    -   You don't need to buy rep for every single group of people who
        might have heard of you!
    -   When you're trying to decide if you need to buy rep, there are
        two major questions:

        -   Is my character's association with this group major enough
            that I want to define it?
        -   Mechanically, do I want to be able to call in favors from
            this group while we're playing the game?

    -   The last question might actually be the most important. We can
        believe that you're a citizen of Kareku Aer even if you don't
        have rep with it; that just means that you're not someone who
        most people on the street would recognize. It's only really
        likely to be worth investing in rep if you want to actually be
        able to call in favors from those people during the game.

-   When you create your character, you get four dots for free, which
    you can distribute between any organizations that your character
    might be known to.

    -   You can purchase more dots at the cost of 10 CP per dot.
    -   During character creation, you can't purchase more than 6 (more)
        dots this way (so your character can't start the game with more
        than 10 dots).
    -   As the game goes on, your character can't have more than 25 dots
        total.

-   You can use your reputation to call in a *favor* from one of your
    organizations.

    -   Each favor has a *level*, which the GM assigns. Favor levels run
        from 1 (for a trivial favor) to 5 (for a major ask).
    -   For example:

        -   Level 1: craft a Minor object, answer a simple question,
            provide common knowledge, allow use of a workspace, let you
            stay the night.
        -   Level 2: answer a complex question, do several hours of
            professional work, take a minor risk, put you up for a week.
        -   Level 3: craft a Moderate object, provide valuable
            information, loan a few hundred copper, provide an alibi.
        -   Level 4: provide difficult-to-acquire or secret information,
            loan a hundred gold, put you up for a month, provide
            professional service for a week, take a major risk.
        -   Level 5: craft a Major item, provide information people
            would die for, loan the use of an estate, let you move in,
            go on a perilous quest with you, help you destroy evidence
        -   Favor levels in need of tweaking.

    -   Under normal circumstances, you can ask for a favor with a
        one-hour task action, requiring a protocol check.

        -   Success means you get the favor you asked for.
        -   If the level of the favor exceeds your rep level (that is,
            the number of dots you have), then you take a -10 penalty.
        -   If your rep level exceeds the level of the favor, you take a
            +10 penalty.
        -   Note: those are "flat" numbers; it's *not* +/- 10 per dot of
            difference.
        -   "normal circumstances" means that the organization has some
            physical presence where you are, and that the organization
            is in a condition where its (other) members are willing to
            grant people favors. This would be the case, for example, if
            the organization in question is a merchant's guild that you
            are a member of, and that has other members operating in the
            city that you're in.
        -   Under unusual circumstances---if there aren't other members
            in the town that you're in, or if some situation (like a
            revolt or attack) prevents the organization from
            operating---you might have to do more work to call in a
            favor, or it might not even be possible at all.

-   Why don't I just get one dot in a network, get really high protocol,
    and then make those people kill for me?

    -   Technically you can, but you'll only get away with it once;
        after that, you'll gain the depleted tag (see below).
    -   If you keep doing that every month---abusing them for obscene
        favors and then working the debt off---the GM might eventually
        decide that the members of that organization are sick your
        shenanigans and either dock you rep, or just suspend you
        outright (see below).
    -   It's also not particularly efficient, unless you were going to
        buy 50 ranks in protocol anyway.

-   Several factors can effect your reputations.

    -   Your reputations can go up and down---you can gain or loose
        dots.

        -   This is usually hard to do: gaining a dot requires either
            years of service, or an accomplishment of major note, or
            both.
        -   Likewise, loosing a dot requires months of negligence, or a
            significant failure, or both.
        -   Which is to say, either awarding or removing dots should
            usually be used to highlight major achievements or failures,
            respectively.
        -   Once you have dots, you can't go below zero (except in
            exceptional circumstances). If you would loose your last
            dot, you gain the Suspended tag instead.
        -   Similarly, you can't go over five dots. If you would gain a
            sixth dot, the GM should allow you to call in a Level 4
            favor "for free" instead. (The favor is subject to GM
            approval.)

    -   If you ask for too many favors in too short a time---or if you
        (successfully) ask for a favor that exceeds your rep level by
        too much---then people won't be willing to do more favors for
        you until you do something for the organization.

        -   When this happens, that rep network gains the *depleted*
            tag. When your rep network has the *depleted* tag, you can't
            use that network for favors (even though your actual score
            hasn't changed).
        -   To remove the *depleted* tag, you need to do enough work for
            the organization that members feel that you have "paid your
            debt" to them.
        -   As a rough guideline, this can usually be done with a one
            month job, requiring a successful check with an appropriate
            skill (often a profession appropriate to the organization).

    -   If you fail your organization spectacularly, betray them, or
        otherwise earn their ire, you might get the *suspended* tag.

        -   When you are *suspended*, the members of the rep network
            treat you as an outsider---you dots with them don't actually
            change, but you are treated as if you had 0 dots.
        -   You obviously cannot use a rep network that you are
            suspended from, and the members of that network might even
            be actively hostile to you (depending on the group's norms
            and rules, and on what you did to get suspended).
        -   You can work your way back into the organization's good
            graces---you can remove the suspended tag---but it's hard to
            do.
        -   There are no hard-and-fast rules for removing the suspended
            status. The details of how you do it will depend on the
            organization and why you got suspended.
        -   (Of course, a character removing the Suspended status might
            be an adventure unto itself!)

    -   When should characters get Suspended, and when should characters
        loose dots?

        -   Loosing dots usually isn't the result of a single event. It
            usually happens slowly: as a character shows less and less
            commitment to an organization, its members think less and
            less of that character.
        -   Getting Suspended usually *is* the result of a single, major
            failure or betrayal.
        -   As a general rule, if you're about to dock a character more
            than one dot of rep at a time, you should probably Suspend
            them instead.
        -   The Suspended tag is also more useful in situations where
            the character might have some reason for what they did, or
            where it might be possible for the character to redeem
            themselves.

-   New Negative Trait: Blacklisted

    -   You are permanently suspended from one organization.
    -   You should work with the GM to design the organization, and the
        GM must approve it.
    -   The organization must be one that it would be useful to you to
        be a member of---for example, it must be an organization that
        you would otherwise be in a position to ask favors of, or that
        you would otherwise be rewarded with rep in.
    -   If you use the rules for buying off negative traits, then,
        before you can ever gain rep in the blacklisted network, you
        must *first* buy off this trait *and then* remove the Suspended
        tag as normal.

-   New Negative Trait: Internal Enemy

    -   requires the Enemy trait, that your enemy is a member of an
        organization that you have at least 3 dots of rep in.
    -   Your enemy is a member of an organization that you are also a
        member of. They will attempt to ruin your reputation and foil
        your attempts to call in favors.
    -   Whenever you attempt to call in a favor, if your enemy is aware
        of what you are doing, they will work against you: you suffer a
        -20 penalty on the test.
    -   Once a month, you must make an opposed Protocol check against
        your enemy. If you fail, you gain the *depleted* tag with that
        organization.

-   New Positive Trait: Networking

    -   You are very good at managing and promoting your reputation with
        one organization.
    -   You do not take the -10 penalty if you call in a favor that
        exceeds your rep by only one.
    -   When you are about to gain the Depleted tag, you may attempt a
        Protocol check at -30. If you succeed, you do not gain the
        Depleted tag.

-   Modified Trait: Wanted

    -   You cannot call in favors from an organization that you are
        Wanted by (that is, that you purchased this trait for).

[]{#anchor-127}Special Attacks
------------------------------

-   Any skilled melee combatant will have developed a repertoire of
    useful tricks, more than simply *sticking pointy end in other
    fighter.* We call these *strikes* and *maneuvers*.

    -   A *strike* is a modification to a normal attack. To make a
        strike, you take a penalty on your attack; if you score an
        Exceptional Success, in addition to the normal affects of the
        attack, you gain the listed Result.

        -   You decide if your attack is going to be a strike before you
            make it (since you have to take a penalty on the attack).
        -   An attack can only be one kind of Strike. (You can't take a
            -20 penalty to have an attac be both a Called Shot an Knock
            Down.)

    -   A *maneuver* isn't made as part of an attack.

        -   Each maneuver will list the type of action required, the
            check, and the result if you succeed.

### []{#anchor-128}Strikes

    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Test: Your melee attack skill vs. target's melee attack skill or
        Fray
    -   Result: If you succeed, then you disarm your opponent, forcing
        them to drop one held item (like a weapon or shield).

-   Feint

    -   Action: Quick Action
    -   Test: Your Deception vs. target's Resist Social Manipulation or
        Read
    -   Result: until the beginning of their next turn, the target takes
        a -20 penalty to their defense.

-   Grabbing

    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Test: your Unarmed Combat vs. target's Fray or Unarmed Combat.
    -   Result: you grab the opponent, impeding them. They cannot easily
        act.
    -   The results are at the GM's discretion, but normally grabbed
        characters cannot take any other actions besides attempting to
        escape the grab.
    -   A grabbed character can attempt to break a grapple, using either
        their Unarmed Combat or their STR+SOM, versus the Unarmed Combat
        of the character grabbing them. If they win, they break free.

-   Trip

    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Test: your melee attack skill vs. target's Fray
    -   Result: You trip your opponent, causing them to fall prone.
