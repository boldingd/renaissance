        <h1>About Renaissance</h1>

        <p>This is the open-source pen-and-paper RPG tentatively titled <em>Renaissance</em> (and colloquially called <em>Gleeches and Dragons</em>, after the online handle of its main author).</p>
<p>It concerns the Commonwealth, an advanced, multi-racial people in a fantasy world.
They have a significant command of magic, and a technology very roughly tracking Europe in late 1400.
They are a peaceful and prosperous nation.</p>
<p>Some of their neighbors are less so, tho: the Kingdoms of Man is riven with internal conflict, the Shaded Sea Peoples are piratical raiders, and the Goblin Kingdoms are slavers and worse.
Perhaps worse are the Spirits--the world of Renaissance is alive with spirits: some are closely aligned with the Commonwealth, regarding mortals as allies and friends; others are aloof, but are willing to offer service in exchange for propitiation; still others are either actively hostile, or completely aloof and inscrutable.</p>
<p>In terms of play, Renaissance leans away from dungeon-crawling: D&amp;D is already an excellent take on that.
It leans towards intrigue campaigns--investigating slave rings, busting smugglers and infiltrating neighboring kingdoms.
Largely because of its Eclipse Phase heritage, it also handles horror well, driven by malevolent spirits--creating a style of play that might be called &quot;Fantasy Call of Cthulhu&quot;.</p>
<p>It is based loosely on the rules from Eclipse Phase, Version 1.
(Which is an excellent game that is well worth playing).
It's released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 4.0 license.</p>
<p>This is obviously a very early draft: it's still a bullet list.
We're still working on getting the rules in place.
If you feel like giving it a play-test or submitting feedback, please do.</p>
<p>The RPG was initially written by and is copyright of David Bolding (<a href="mailto:boldingd@gmail.com">boldingd@gmail.com</a>), with significant contributions from Alexis Williams (<a href="https://typedr.at">@typedrat</a>) and others.</p>
