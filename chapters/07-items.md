title: Items
---
Items come in three categories, _minor_, _normal _and_ major_. This
mainly determines their cost when purchased at character creation. A
_minor _item is one useful piece of gear, like a grappling-hook or
ladder (if you just want a ladder, you can pay 1 CP and get a ladder). A
medium item is a useful, notable item -- any one weapon or piece of
armor would be a medium item, or a skill kit (see below). Finally, a
Major item plays a major roll in defining a character; this might
include a magic weapon, an heirloom, a shop or a plot of land.

We don\\'t have particular _magic item_ rules; like powers, major items
are intended to be worked out between the GM and the player.

It\\'s worth noting that this game is intended to be less gear-focused
than other fantasy adventure games (that is, for example, D&D). The
intent is that a character is mostly defined by their Skills first, and
there-after by their Traits, Race, Backgrounds, Classes and Powers.

Some items have keywords. Most of these keywords do not have affects
themselves, but do interact with traits, powers and other rules.

Several of these items are heavy or cumbersome. Rather than attempting
to track item weight in detail, items that are particularly bulky are
given the _Heavy_ keyword. To determine how many _Heavy_ items a
character can carry without penalty, divide their STR by 10 and round
down. For every additional _Heavy_ item beyond this number, the
character suffers a -10 penalty to all physical actions. Other affects
(such as fatigue or immobility) may be applied at GM discretion.

## Magic Items

-   Common Magic Items:

    -   Light: this small glass vile contains a clear liquid. When
        shaken, it produces a bright light: it shines brightly enough
        that a character holding it can see clearly for 20m around them.
        Once it is lit, it will continue to shine until it is shaken
        again, which deactivates it.
    -   Safe-Fall Cape: this cape billows outward as you fall, and both
        it's physical size and magical effects cooperate to slow your
        fall. No matter how far you fall, the cape will prevent you from
        falling faster than a quick run. When you land, you must make an
        athletics check: if you succeed, you take no damage, but if you
        fail, you take 1d10 dv.
    -   Torque of Speaking: you may use one additional language group
        (pick one when purchasing this item).

        -   Note that the torque is giving you access to a language
            group, and not ranks in a specific language. If you're a
            human, you can use a torque to make the sounds needed to
            speak Gnollish (in the language-group GR), but you'd still
            need to have ranks in Language: Heartland Gnoll to actually
            speak it.

    -   Wand:

        -   Attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1d10-2 Damage, Ignores Armor.

            -   Range: 30m (short) / 50m / 70m
            -   Requires 10 ranks in Spellcraft to use (no check is
                required)

        -   Is this potentially fun or stupid?

## Alchemical Items (Drugs, Poisons, Potions and Bombs)

-   I might want to lay out explicit rules for chemicals, either here or
    somewhere else.

    -   I might add Splash as an alternative to Blast, and then separate
        the rules for f.ex. Tar the chemical from using it as a grenade.
    -   On the other hand, how many times will I do that? Is there a
        third one, besides Scour and Tar?

-   Minor

    -   Stim: +2 INIT. Duration: one hour
    -   Healing: regain 1 DUR / Day, +10 on checks made to resist
        disease. Duration: 1 Day
    -   Numbing: negate one wound, -2 Init
    -   Shrooms!: +5 INT, -5 COO, -5 REF. Duration: one hour.
    -   Meth!: +5 REF, -5 INT, -5 WIL. +10 to task actions, but cannot
        make passive checks. Duration: one hour.
    -   Grenade (Grenade):

        -   Attack: thrown, 2D10 DV
        -   Tags: Burst and Fire

    -   Cocktail (Grenade):

        -   Attack: thrown, 1D10+2DV
        -   Tags: Burst and Fire
        -   When it lands, anything in the Burst is covered in burning
            liguid, and set on fire.
        -   Will continue to burn for 10 minutes, doing 1d10+2DV to
            anything covered by the liquid, or in the burning area.
        -   A character who is covered by the liquid may extinguish
            themselves as a Standard Action; they must stop, drop and
            roll to do this, and so they wind up prone afterwards.

    -   Smoke:

        -   Attack: Thrown Weapon
        -   Tags: Burst and Smoke
        -   Produces a cloud of smoke, with a radius of 1D10+3m and
            centered where the Smoke landed.
        -   Creatures in the cloud are obscured; they have Cover (see
            Combat)

-   Medium

    -   Healing (Potion): regain 1 DUR / Hour; regain 1 Wound / 12
        Hours, after all DUR is healed. Duration: 12 hours.

        -   Tags: Magical

    -   Monster (Potion): Gain +10 DUR and +10 STR (this adjusts your
        WT, DR and DB). However, you also take -10 SAV.

        -   Tags: Magical

    -   Scour (Chemical):

        -   Scour is highly caustic; it will dissolve most solid
            objects, and will cause terrible chemical burns to flesh and
            bone.
        -   If used to cover a solid object, that object will take
            1d10+3DV per turn.
        -   If used to cover a character, then that character sustains
            2d10DV per turn.
        -   Fortunately, Scour dissolves in water, making it very easy
            to wash off (if water is available).
        -   If ingested, Scour is lethal, dealing 3D10DV a turn until
            the character dies; fortunately, it is visually distinct
            (being a pale, greenish paste), and the taste is obvious
            (and _horrible_).
        -   Scour doesn't dissolve glass; therefore, a bottle of it can
            be thrown.

            -   Attack: Thrown Weapon, Splash 1D10รท2m
            -   Tags: Splash, Caustic
            -   Anything in the Splash is covered in Scour.

    -   Tar (Chemical): this viscous and sticky substance is highly
        flammable; though it doesn't burn as hot as the mix of alcohol
        and water used in a Cocktail, it burns much longer and is very
        difficult to either remove or extinguish (pouring water on it
        will do neither).

        -   Being covered in Tar is unpleasant, but not immediately
            dangerous; unlike actual tar, it doesn't harden.
        -   Tar is very flammable, however; burning Tar deals 1D10DV per
            turn to anything in contact with it.
        -   Tar is very difficult to extinguish. Dropping and rolling
            will not extinguish it.
        -   Tar is often prepared in a glass or clay container with a
            lit wick, creating a device like a Cocktail:

            -   Attack: Thrown Weapon, Splash, 1D10m
            -   Tags: Splash, Fire
            -   Anything in the splash is covered in burning Tar.

## Skill Kits and Shops

-   associated with a specific skill

    -   some skills can\\'t be practiced _without_ a skill kit

-   have the tools useful to perform that skill
-   Note: when you buy a skill kit, you may specify three Minor items
    that the kit definitely contains.

    -   You don\\'t have to do this, but it can be useful for declaring
        that you _definitely_ have a specific item
    -   for example, with a Craft: Blacksmithing kit, you might specify
        that it _definitely_ contains a blacksmithing hammer.

-   Shops are more extensive facilities; they function like Skill Kits,
    but they allow users to pursue larger or longer-term projects. Shops
    provide a +10 on the linked skill.

## Acquiring Items

-   Acquiring items

    -   several different ways to acquire items. Two major ones have
        specific rules: Bartering for goods, and paying for them with
        Currency

-   Bartering:

    -   Use Trade Goods

        -   Trade goods are either Minor, Moderate or Major. (This is
            also their item category, as above).\* _At any given time,
            your Trade Goods can be _depleted_ or not (that is, they can
            have the _depleted\* tag or not).

    -   When you barter for an item, roll Barter.

        -   You must have some Trade Goods to offer, and the Trade Goods
            you use cannot be _depleted_.
        -   On a Success, you receive the item, and your Trade Goods
            become depleted.
        -   On an Exceptional Success, you receive the item, but your
            Trade Goods do not become depleted
        -   On a Failure, you do not receive the item (and nothing
            happens to your Trade Goods)

    -   Bonuses

        -   you receive a +10 bonus for each category by which your
            Trade Goods exceed the category of the item you're after
        -   You receive a -10 penalty for each category by which the
            item exceeds your Trade Goods

    -   Restoring Trade Goods

        -   you may replenish your Trade Goods (that is, remove the
            _depleted_ tag) with a successful Profession check. This is
            a Job with:

            -   a one Shift time-frame for Minor Trade Goods
            -   a five Shift time-frame and a -10 modifier for Moderate
                Trade Goods
            -   a 25 Shift time-frame and a -20 modifier for Major Trade
                Goods

    -   Creating Trade Goods

        -   you can create Trade Goods using a Profession skill.
            Creating Trade Goods is a Job that:

            -   has a 5 Shift time-frame for Minor Trade Goods
            -   has a 25 Shift time-frame and a -10 modifier for
                Moderaate Trade Goods
            -   has a 200 Shift time-frame and a -20 modifier for Major
                Trade Goods

-   Paying for items with Currency

    -   Currency is measured in Copper Pieces
    -   GM will determine prices, with the following as a guide:

        -   Minor: 5 copper
        -   Moderate: 100 copper
        -   Major: 1,000 copper

## Creating Items

-   Characters can use their Craft skills to create items directly.

    -   This requires an appropriate _skill kit_ and raw materials to
        work with.
    -   This requires the character succeed on an appropriate Craft
        check.

        -   Creating a _Significant Magic Item_ also requires a
            Spellcraft check.

-   Time Frames at GM's discretion, with the following guidelines:

    -   Minor Item: two hour Task Action
    -   Moderate Item: ~~one day~~ 1 shift Job
    -   Major Item: ~~one month~~ 25 shift Job

-   Raw Materials

    -   Characters need raw materials to make things---but how do you
        determine if characters have raw materials? There isn't a Raw
        Materials item, and there aren't rules for it.
    -   Our answer is: assume they have raw materials, unless there's a
        very good reason that they don't.

        -   For example, if they've had to flee their homes at short
            notice, if they've been traveling light for days, or if
            they've been captured.

    -   If GMs (or players) want a more definite system for tracking raw
        materials, see Raw Materials in Optional Rules.
