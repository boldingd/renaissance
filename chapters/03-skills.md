## Skill List

-   Animal Handling (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Animal Handling is used as the "Social Skill for Animals". It's
        used to coax animals into behaving how you want.
    -   Animal Handling can be used to train an animal, but we don't
        provide detailed rules for that. This is generally best handled
        either by purchasing a Class or Power (like Wildlander), or by
        purchasing the animal companion as a Moderate or Major Item and
        then building it using the rules for Followers.
    -   Sample Specialization: by a family of animals (canines, felines,
        equines, etc.), or by role (combat, work, companion, riding)

-   Art (INT, Field Skill)

    -   Active, Knowledge
    -   Sample Fields: Literature, Painting, Sculpture, Theater
    -   Specializations: by field

    -   Active, Movement, Physical
    -   Represents your characters' general athletic ability.

        swimming
    -   For expertise in specific sports, see Sport.

-   Barter (SAV)

    -   Active, Social, Technical, Trade
    -   Your ability to acquire things you need (or want) at a good
        price; used in the rules for _Acquiring Items_.
    -   Barter is specifically used for trading, which normally means
        when acquiring goods (as in _Items_, below). Normally,
        negotiations (like legal bartering in a courtroom) are handled
        with Protocol (see below).
    -   It seems far more specific than these other skills, but it's
        useful because other mechanics us it. Still a little torn on
        this'n.

-   Bladed Weapons (SOM)

    -   Active, Attack, Combat, Melee Attack, Physical
    -   Used for yer stabbin'

-   Deception (SAV)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Used to deceive people in social situations---to make other
        characters believe what you want them to believe.
    -   Can also be used (probably in conjunction with Disguise) to hide
        your identity, and possibly to impersonate someone else.
        (Obviously, impersonating a specific person will be very tricky,
        and might not be possible at all if you don't have information
        about that person to go on, or are forced to interact with
        people who know that person well.)
    -   For minor or simple lies, can be used unopposed.
    -   For big lies, important scenes or major characters, your
        Deception is opposed by either the target's Read or their Resist
        Social Manipulation.
    -   Example Specializations: lying, negotiating, impersonation

    -   Usually used unopposed, although the quality of the device might
        impose a penalty (or allow a bonus).

    -   maybe should be COG or COO, but hey, not enough REF skills.

-   Disguise (INT)

    -   Active, Social
    -   Disguise is used to physically disguise yourself as someone
        else.
    -   You will often also need to have _Deception_ in order to pass
        yourself off as someone else in a social situation.

-   Exotic Skill (Attribute Varies, Field Skill)

    -   Exotic, _other tags_

    -   Exotic Knowledge (COG, for esoteric knowledge)
    -   Exotic Mount (REF or SAV)
    -   Exotic Movement (SOM or COO)
    -   Don't be too eager to resort to Exotic Skills! You are _almost
        always_ better served by using a normal skill, perhaps with a
        specialization to indicate your unique background or interest.

        maneuvering.
    -   There's no rule against a creature that can't fly taking ranks
        in the fly skill---although it also won't do them much good.

-   Intimidate (SAV)
    -   Active, Combat, Social
    -   Used to represent your characters ability to manipulate others
        through menace rather than poise.
    -   Usually used opposed, against the target's _Resist Intimidation_
        (see _Special Numbers _below).
    -   Specialization: by circumstance (interrogation, combat) or by
        method (physical intimidation, blackmail)

-   Investigate (INT)
    -   Active, Technical

-   Knowledge (COG, Field Skill)
    -   Passive, Knowledge, Mental, Technical
    -   Represents knowledge in some area of interest for your
        character.
    -   Almost anything can be a Knowledge field. When selecting a
        field, be careful: it shouldn't be so narrow that it never
        applies, but it also shouldn't be so broad that it _always_
        applies.
    -   Example Fields:

        -   by interest: Criminal Gangs, Folklore, Local Religions,
            Military Tactics, Noble Lines

    -   Active, Social
    -   Used when attempting to convince a character to go along with
        something.
    -   For minor dealings with an NPC, usually used unopposed. For
        important tests, or when an NPC is skeptical or requires

        appropriate Knowledge or Profession skill.

-   Ride (REF)

    -   Active, Movement, Physical
    -   Ride checks represent your skill at riding steeds (and possibly
        other conveyances, magical and mundane).
    -   A character with basic competence (that is, 10 ranks in ride)
        doesn't need to make a Ride check for normal movement with a
        mount: if you know how to ride a horse, you don't need to make a
        test to ride to town.
    -   Ride is a "movement skill," commonly used either for difficult
        maneuvers or for chases (see _Movement Modes_).
    -   Can specialize in an individual creature (like Horses) or an

        artifacts at a ruin, evidence at a crime scene, a secret door

        Stealth if they're trying to avoid being followed).

    -   Active, Physical
    -   Used for pick-pocketing, hiding (or retrieving) objects on your
        person, misdirection and simple tricks and illusions.

        character's ability to survive on the streets of a large city.
    -   Example Specializations: by terrain type (woodlands, jungles,
        deserts, tundras, etc.)

-   Stealth (COO)

    -   Active, Combat, Physical
    -   Represents your ability to go unnoticed.
    -   Used for sneaking about; if you're trying to sneak past an
        observer, used opposed by the guard's Perception.
    -   Can be used to blend in to a crowd, in which case it's usually
        used unopposed.
    -   If you are trying to follow someone without being noticed, then
        it is opposed by that person's Perception.
    -   Can be used to travel without leaving a trail.
    -   To avoid being seen, you normally need something to hide behind;
        it's hard to hide from someone if they can plainly see you.
    -   Some sense (like Scent or Mage Sight) might also render Stealth
        impractical.
    -   Sample Specializations: Sneaking, Blending In

Sidebar: Unusual Skills

-   Sometimes you'll want your character to be able to do something that
    isn't exactly covered by a skill---like tracking game through the
    woods.
-   While players can use an Exotic Skill to take ranks in an unusual
    skill, they are usually better served by taking an existing skill
    with a descriptive specialization. For example, players would almost
    always be better off taking Search \[Tracking] than taking Exotic
    Skill: Tracking.
-   The Knowledge and Profession skills can also be used to establish a
    specific special skill-set for a character---for example,
    Profession: Hunter or Interest: Tracking.
-   In addition to thinking about how you want to represent your
    character's talents, think about how you want to be able to _use_
    the skill during a game.
-   If you're unsure about a skill selection, you should discuss it with
    the GM; make sure that the GM understands not only what you want the
    skill to represent, but what you want to be able to _do_ with it,
    and be sure that you and the GM agree with not only what the skill
    is supposed to represent, but what it's supposed to do and how it's
    supposed to work.

Sidebar: Gotchas and Confusing Cases

-   Disguise only covers the _physical_ half of pretending to be someone
    else; for the social half---that is, to talk to people without being
    discovered---you'll also need Deception.
-   Search is used to actively search an area for something; it takes
    time, and you move around. Perception is usually used for noticing
    things quickly---seeing things when you enter a room, as opposed to
    after looking around. Search is also used to track someone or
    something.
-   Control is used to manage your own magical energies, and to develop
    sleights; it should not be used to represent a characters "will
    power," that's the WIL attribute.
-   Investigate is primarily a mental action: it can be used to solve a
    mystery, given clues that have already be found. To actually find
    clues (at a crime scene, for example), use Search.
-   Normally, solving a crime would be treated as Solving a Logic Puzzle
    (requiring a COG × 3 check, as below). If you would like to build a
    detective character, consider using Profession: Detective or
    Profession: Investigator to represent your character's ability to
    solve mysteries.

## Special Numbers:

Sometimes no skill applies: in these cases, use combinations of
Aptitudes. Some common examples follow:

-   Resist Intimidation / Overcome Fear: WIL × 2
-   Resist Social Manipulation: SAV + INT
-   Recall Personal Experience: COG × 3
-   Take a Chance, Get Lucky: Luck × 10

    -   Note, that's the Luck stat, not your current Luck Points

-   Make A Guess (or Get a Hint): INT × 3
-   Solve a Logic Puzzle: COG × 3
-   Feat of Strength (bend bars, break down a door): SOM + STR
-   Feat of Endurance (endure a long march, resist disease, survive
    starvation): DUR + WIL
-   React Quickly: REF × 3
-   Catch Something: COO + REF + REF
