title: Alternate Rules
---

The following are alternate rules systems. Some of them might be ideas
that I'm playing with for future inclusion, while others might just be
common systems that most people would house-rule in if we didn't cover
them. Some are just good rules that we didn't think fit in the core
rules, for one reason or another.

## Buying Back Negative Traits

-   Sometimes a player might want to remove a negative trait that
    they've acquired.

    -   Maybe a negative trait they selected during character creation
        is turning out to be more of a hassle than they thought it
        would, or
    -   maybe they acquired the trait during play and want to get rid of
        it (who wants to be Wanted forever?).

-   Using these rules, when a character is spending rez, they may spend
    an amount of Rez equal to the CP bonus from a negative trait to "buy
    it off"---that is, remove it.
-   Optionally, the GM can rule that some negative traits cannot simply
    be bought off, but might require some in-character action.

    -   Buying back the Wanted trait, for example, might be an
        interesting adventure in itself.
    -   Of course, when this happens, the GM should lower the cost in
        Rez to buy the trait off (potentially even all the way to 0).
        This essentially represents giving the character credit for the
        extra work that they're doing.

## Creating Advantage

-   This alternate rule represents a system for using one skill to help
    out with another

    -   it replaces the Related Skill and Assisting Characters bonuses.

-   Characters can attempt to create advantage for an upcoming check,
    called the Primary Check.
-   To create an advantage, a character picks a skill that could be used
    to help---usually a skill that could be a related skill, or that
    could be used to assist. They then roll a Simple Check: if they
    succeed, then the primary check has _advantage._
-   If a character has advantage on a test, then they select on effect
    that they would normally spend a Luck Point for, and again that
    benefit.
-   A character can potentially create advantage for themselves, or for
    other characters.

-   For example, suppose you'd like to sit in a market and listen for
    local gossip, but you want to do so without attracting attention.
    This is naturally a Stealth test, since you're trying to "blend in."
    But, if you're a social character, you might not have a good Stealth
    rating.

    -   With the normal rules, you might ask the GM if you can use your
        Protocol as a related skill---representing you using your
        knowledge of social norms to be inconspicuous.

-   The test that you would like to create an advantage for is the
    _primary test_, and the skill that you would like to use to create
    that advantage is the _secondary skill_.
-   To create advantage, before making the primary test, make a Simple
    Success Check using the secondary skill; if you excel, you gain
    _advantage_ on the primary test.
-   If you have _advantage_ on a test, you may select one effect that
    you would normally spend a Luck Point for, and gain that benefit.
    (So you could choose to remove all negative modifiers, for example.)

    -   You still have to follow the restrictions about when you can
        spend a luck point. For example, you can't decide before you
        roll that you'd like to flip your result, and you can't decide
        after you roll that you'd like to remove all negative modifiers.

-   Sometimes, creating advantage doesn't require a discrete action; if
    you're using your Academics: Alchemy to help you craft a potion,
    then the Academics: Alchemy secondary skill test isn't a separate
    action from the Task Action to brew the potion.

    -   Someteimes, however, you _can_ create advantage as a separate
        action. If you research a noble's family history in a library
        before attempting to arrange a meeting, then you can represent
        that by using a Research test (a Task Action) to create
        advantage on the following Protocol test.

## Fate Points

-   "Borrowed" from Fate.
-   We hate Fate, but hey, other people like it, so for them, there's
    the Fate Points alternative rule.
-   This optional rule adds a new stat: similar to Luck Points,
    characters now have the Fate stat and Fate Points.
-   Each character also receives 1 Fate for free during character
    creation, and they can increase their Fate by 1 for 15 CP.
-   Like Luck, characters begin play with a number of Fate Points equal
    to their Fate stat; over the course of the game, they can gain,
    spend and lose Fate Points, but their Fate state remains the same.
-   Players may spend a Fate Point to do the following:

    -   Specify some useful detail about their surroundings---like a
        window that they can jump through to escape Danger 5, or paint
        they can use to pretend they have clothes on.
    -   Specify some connection they have to an NPC (such as that they
        served in the same regiment).
    -   To avoid dying when reaching their DR (additional damage is
        discarded).

-   GMs may veto a use of a Fate Point if it is absurd, disruptive or
    completely implausible.
-   Any suggestions for rules for gaining and loosing Fate Points?

## Guns

-   We don't include guns in the main game, as, if they're done remotely
    realistically, they change the game dramatically.
-   In particular, they're likely to make bows and arrows irrelevant.
-   Still, simple guns (like blunderbusses) are features of many fantasy
    setting and archetypes, so we've decided to provide sample gun rules
    here.
-   Guns are handled using the Projectile Weapons skill.
-   Guns are usually loaded by ramming black powder and a ball or
    canister down the barrel; this is usually a Standard Action.
-   The powder is ruined if it gets wet---although it can be stored in
    water-tight containers. Obviously, guns cannot be fired or loaded
    under water.
-   Once you know how to do it, the chemistry to produce black powder
    isn't particularly difficult. Black powder can be produced with a
    Craft: Chemistry check, with a +10 modifier.
-   10 balls and enough black powder to fire them can be purchased for
    Cost: Low.

-   Blunderbuss

    -   Blunderbusses are short-barreled weapons with fluted ends; they
        aren't particularly accurate, and are usually used to fire
        shot---although they can also be loaded with other projectiles
        as well. Some examples are given below.
    -   Ball: 2d10+4 DV, AP -5
    -   Scatter: 1d10+4 DV, AP -1, splash 3m
    -   Scour Canister: 3m splash, covers targets with Scour.
    -   Range: short 15m / medium 25m / long 35m

-   Dragon

    -   The Dragon is the short, one-handed version of the Blunderbuss.
        It uses lighter loads and smaller projectiles.
    -   Ball: 2d10+2 DV, AP -3
    -   Scatter: 1d10+2 DV, AP -1, splash 3m
    -   Scour Canister: 2m splash, covers targets with Scour.
    -   Range: short 10m / medium 20m / long 30m

-   Musket

    -   A musket is a long-gun that fires a single ball. While their
        wounds are gruesome, they are even more notable for being very
        effective at penetrating armor.
    -   Muskets do 3d10 DV, and have AP -7
    -   Range: short 20m / medium 30m / long 40m / extreme 50m

## Momentum and Threat

-   Sometimes you score a critical success on a boring and uninteresting
    check; other times, your players score a critical failure on a
    boring and trivial check; and sometimes nobody can think of a good
    critical effect---what does critically succeeding on a test to make
    three dozen spoons even look like?
-   The Star Trek RPG has a great system for this, and we're adding it
    as an optional rule.
-   This rule adds two new _pools_, _momentum_ and _complications_.

    -   These pools aren't individual character stats; instead, they're
        shared by the party (in the case of _momentum_) and managed by
        the GM (in the case of _complications_).
    -   So the party has one shared Momentum pool that everyone uses,
        and the GM has one Threat pool that they will draw from.
    -   The GM may choose to let the party see the Threat pool, or to
        keep it secret.

-   Each pool starts at 0, and can be raised as high as the number of
    players, including the GM(s) (so if there are 5 players and 1 GM,
    then each pool can go up to 6).
-   When the players score an exceptional or critical success, they can
    choose to Downgrade. If they do, then they gain (or "bank") one
    Momentum.
-   Likewise, if an (opponent) NPC scores a Critical or Exceptional
    Success, the GM may choose to Downgrade in order to gain (or bank)
    one Threat.
-   If a player scores an Exceptional or Critical Failure, the GM may
    offer to gain one Threat in exchange for allowing the player to
    Upgrade.
-   A player may spend Momentum to:

    -   gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Luck Points;
    -   gain any benefit they could spend a Fate Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Fate Points (if using the Fate Points
        alternate rules);
    -   re-roll a check (at the cost of 2 Momentum);
    -   Deal maximum damage with an attack (at the cost of 2 Momentum).

-   A GM may spend Threat to:

    -   force a player to re-roll a Test;
    -   introduce a new obstacle that hinders the players, such as a
        guard showing up at the wrong time or a petty noble deciding
        they'll spend the rest of the day making the player's lives Hard
        (at the cost of 2 Threat, so make it a good one!);
    -   have one NPC gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for,
        according to the rules for spending Luck Points;
    -   halve the damage inflicted by an attack (at the cost of 2
        Threat)

-   Part of the intent of Momentum and Threat is to give them game a
    more cinematic feel; both GMs and players should bear that in mind
    when banking and spending.
-   How momentum is spent is a party decision, which is to say, we
    provide no guidance for what GMs should do if the party doesn't
    agree on how to spend a Momentum.

    -   If you'd like to turn your gaming table into a Friendship
        Destruction Simulator, you can try allowing any player to spend
        Momentum unilaterally; be prepared for fratricide.

-   If anyone has some other suggestions for ways to spend Momentum,
    that'd be rad.

## Raw Materials

-   The rules for crafting tell you that you need "raw materials" to
    craft, but they (implicitly) leave it up to the GM to determine if
    that's the case.

    -   The following rules allow players to purchase and track their
        use of raw materials, and are useful for GMs who want to make
        resource management a part of their game.

-   You may purchase raw materials for a given Craft skill---for
    example, "Craft: Alchemy Raw Materials"

    -   Raw Materials are Moderate items, and have the Heavy tag.

-   When you purchase Raw Materials, they have 20 charges.

    -   Crafting a Minor item consumes 1 charge.
    -   Crafting a Moderate item consumes 5 charges.
    -   Crafting a Major item consumes 10 charges.
    -   Your raw materials are consumed when they run out of charges.

-   We don't provide rules for "recharging" Raw Materials: when you
    deplete your Raw Materials, you should simply buy more.
-   Note that raw materials, though heavy, are portable.

    -   GMs may rule that some tasks require more resources than raw
        materials provide; for example, Craft: Sculpture raw materials
        might not have enough marble to carve a life-sized statue.
    -   GMs may also rule that Raw Materials just don't make sense for
        some skills; for example, enough marble to build a castle would
        cost more than a Moderate item and be more than Heavy, so Craft:
        Masonry Raw Materials might not be allowed.

## Reactions

-   Consider a caster-character standing behind and to the side of a
    fighter-character; with the rules as they are, nothing stops an
    enemy from simply _walking around_ the fighter character and
    attacking the caster character.

    -   Reactions provide a framework for taking _reactions_ outside of
        your turn, which includes as a primary use-case allowing
        fighter-type characters to attack people who try to move past
        them.
    -   This allows fighter-types to better control an area, and to
        better defend their team-mates.

-   Using these rules, you may sometimes take actions outside of your
    turn.

    -   An action taken outside of your turn is called a _reaction_.
    -   Once you take a reaction, you cannot take _another_ reaction
        until the end of your next turn. (Roughly, you only get one
        reaction per turn.)

-   Readied Actions: as a Standard Action, you may _ready_ an action: if
    you do, specify another Standard Action, and a condition. If the
    condition occurs before your next turn, you may choose to take the
    specified action.

    -   Activating your a Readied Action is a reaction.

-   Attacks of Opportunity: if a character who you threaten attempts to
    move away from or past you, you may make an attack against them.
    This uses all the normal rules for an attack. This doesn't hinder
    their movement, unless you incapacitate them with your attack (by
    knocking them over for example).

    -   An Attack of Opportunity is a reaction.

## Reputation

-   Characters might be members of guilds, gangs, temples or other
    organizations.

    -   Tracking their rising and falling status within those
        organizations can be interesting fuel for roleplay and
        adventure, and can help people flesh out their characters.
    -   Here are optional rules for tracking character's _reputations_.

-   If you use these rules, your character can have _reputation(s)_ with
    one or more _organization_.

    -   For each organization that you are known to, you have a
        reputation score (hereafter, "rep").
    -   "Organization" here is used somewhat loosely: it might be a
        literal organization, like a trade guild, but it might also be a
        town, a gang, a temple, a university, or a secret society---or
        just a group of people.
    -   Your rep score consists of between 1 and 5 "dots".
    -   At one dot, you're a new member, just making your way; at 5
        dots, you are a pillar of the community, widely known and
        greatly respected within the organization.
    -   (There are potentially infinitely many organizations that you
        are not a member of---with which you have 0 dots. We don't track
        those for obvious reasons.)
    -   Each of your reputation scores might also have either the
        _depleted_ or _suspended _tag (or both). These will be described
        below.

-   Example Organizations:

    -   a specific temple (rep: Bronze Hills Monastery)
    -   a commonwealth council organization (rep: Commonwealth Navy, rep
        Commonwealth Engineers)
    -   a specific guild (rep: Brier-Treaders Explorer League, rep:
        Heartland Mason's Guild)
    -   a specific university or field of study (rep: Correspondence of
        Heartland Philosophers, rep Haven Isle Astronomical Society)
    -   a group of people (rep: Windward Isle Dock-Hands, rep: Citizenry
        of Kareku Aer)

-   When do I need to buy rep?

    -   You don't need to buy rep for every single group of people who
        might have heard of you!
    -   When you're trying to decide if you need to buy rep, there are
        two major questions:

        -   Is my character's association with this group major enough
            that I want to define it?
        -   Mechanically, do I want to be able to call in favors from
            this group while we're playing the game?

    -   The last question might actually be the most important. We can
        believe that you're a citizen of Kareku Aer even if you don't
        have rep with it; that just means that you're not someone who
        most people on the street would recognize. It's only really
        likely to be worth investing in rep if you want to actually be
        able to call in favors from those people during the game.

-   When you create your character, you get four dots for free, which
    you can distribute between any organizations that your character
    might be known to.

    -   You can purchase more dots at the cost of 10 CP per dot.
    -   During character creation, you can't purchase more than 6 (more)
        dots this way (so your character can't start the game with more
        than 10 dots).
    -   As the game goes on, your character can't have more than 25 dots
        total.

-   You can use your reputation to call in a _favor_ from one of your
    organizations.

    -   Each favor has a _level_, which the GM assigns. Favor levels run
        from 1 (for a trivial favor) to 5 (for a major ask).
    -   For example:

        -   Level 1: craft a Minor object, answer a simple question,
            provide common knowledge, allow use of a workspace, let you
            stay the night.
        -   Level 2: answer a complex question, do several hours of
            professional work, take a minor risk, put you up for a week.
        -   Level 3: craft a Moderate object, provide valuable
            information, loan a few hundred copper, provide an alibi.
        -   Level 4: provide difficult-to-acquire or secret information,
            loan a hundred gold, put you up for a month, provide
            professional service for a week, take a major risk.
        -   Level 5: craft a Major item, provide information people
            would die for, loan the use of an estate, let you move in,
            go on a perilous quest with you, help you destroy evidence
        -   Favor levels in need of tweaking.

    -   Under normal circumstances, you can ask for a favor with a
        one-hour task action, requiring a protocol check.

        -   Success means you get the favor you asked for.
        -   If the level of the favor exceeds your rep level (that is,
            the number of dots you have), then you take a -10 penalty.
        -   If your rep level exceeds the level of the favor, you take a
            \+10 penalty.
        -   Note: those are "flat" numbers; it's _not_ +/- 10 per dot of
            difference.
        -   "normal circumstances" means that the organization has some
            physical presence where you are, and that the organization
            is in a condition where its (other) members are willing to
            grant people favors. This would be the case, for example, if
            the organization in question is a merchant's guild that you
            are a member of, and that has other members operating in the
            city that you're in.
        -   Under unusual circumstances---if there aren't other members
            in the town that you're in, or if some situation (like a
            revolt or attack) prevents the organization from
            operating---you might have to do more work to call in a
            favor, or it might not even be possible at all.

-   Why don't I just get one dot in a network, get really high protocol,
    and then make those people kill for me?

    -   Technically you can, but you'll only get away with it once;
        after that, you'll gain the depleted tag (see below).
    -   If you keep doing that every month---abusing them for obscene
        favors and then working the debt off---the GM might eventually
        decide that the members of that organization are sick your
        shenanigans and either dock you rep, or just suspend you
        outright (see below).
    -   It's also not particularly efficient, unless you were going to
        buy 50 ranks in protocol anyway.

-   Several factors can effect your reputations.

    -   Your reputations can go up and down---you can gain or loose
        dots.

        -   This is usually hard to do: gaining a dot requires either
            years of service, or an accomplishment of major note, or
            both.
        -   Likewise, loosing a dot requires months of negligence, or a
            significant failure, or both.
        -   Which is to say, either awarding or removing dots should
            usually be used to highlight major achievements or failures,
            respectively.
        -   Once you have dots, you can't go below zero (except in
            exceptional circumstances). If you would loose your last
            dot, you gain the Suspended tag instead.
        -   Similarly, you can't go over five dots. If you would gain a
            sixth dot, the GM should allow you to call in a Level 4
            favor "for free" instead. (The favor is subject to GM
            approval.)

    -   If you ask for too many favors in too short a time---or if you
        (successfully) ask for a favor that exceeds your rep level by
        too much---then people won't be willing to do more favors for
        you until you do something for the organization.

        -   When this happens, that rep network gains the _depleted_
            tag. When your rep network has the _depleted_ tag, you can't
            use that network for favors (even though your actual score
            hasn't changed).
        -   To remove the _depleted_ tag, you need to do enough work for
            the organization that members feel that you have "paid your
            debt" to them.
        -   As a rough guideline, this can usually be done with a one
            month job, requiring a successful check with an appropriate
            skill (often a profession appropriate to the organization).

    -   If you fail your organization spectacularly, betray them, or
        otherwise earn their ire, you might get the _suspended_ tag.

        -   When you are _suspended_, the members of the rep network
            treat you as an outsider---you dots with them don't actually
            change, but you are treated as if you had 0 dots.
        -   You obviously cannot use a rep network that you are
            suspended from, and the members of that network might even
            be actively hostile to you (depending on the group's norms
            and rules, and on what you did to get suspended).
        -   You can work your way back into the organization's good
            graces---you can remove the suspended tag---but it's hard to
            do.
        -   There are no hard-and-fast rules for removing the suspended
            status. The details of how you do it will depend on the
            organization and why you got suspended.
        -   (Of course, a character removing the Suspended status might
            be an adventure unto itself!)

    -   When should characters get Suspended, and when should characters
        loose dots?

        -   Loosing dots usually isn't the result of a single event. It
            usually happens slowly: as a character shows less and less
            commitment to an organization, its members think less and
            less of that character.
        -   Getting Suspended usually _is_ the result of a single, major
            failure or betrayal.
        -   As a general rule, if you're about to dock a character more
            than one dot of rep at a time, you should probably Suspend
            them instead.
        -   The Suspended tag is also more useful in situations where
            the character might have some reason for what they did, or
            where it might be possible for the character to redeem
            themselves.

-   New Negative Trait: Blacklisted

    -   You are permanently suspended from one organization.
    -   You should work with the GM to design the organization, and the
        GM must approve it.
    -   The organization must be one that it would be useful to you to
        be a member of---for example, it must be an organization that
        you would otherwise be in a position to ask favors of, or that
        you would otherwise be rewarded with rep in.
    -   If you use the rules for buying off negative traits, then,
        before you can ever gain rep in the blacklisted network, you
        must _first_ buy off this trait _and then_ remove the Suspended
        tag as normal.

-   New Negative Trait: Internal Enemy

    -   requires the Enemy trait, that your enemy is a member of an
        organization that you have at least 3 dots of rep in.
    -   Your enemy is a member of an organization that you are also a
        member of. They will attempt to ruin your reputation and foil
        your attempts to call in favors.
    -   Whenever you attempt to call in a favor, if your enemy is aware
        of what you are doing, they will work against you: you suffer a
        \-20 penalty on the test.
    -   Once a month, you must make an opposed Protocol check against
        your enemy. If you fail, you gain the _depleted_ tag with that
        organization.

-   New Positive Trait: Networking

    -   You are very good at managing and promoting your reputation with
        one organization.
    -   You do not take the -10 penalty if you call in a favor that
        exceeds your rep by only one.
    -   When you are about to gain the Depleted tag, you may attempt a
        Protocol check at -30. If you succeed, you do not gain the
        Depleted tag.

-   Modified Trait: Wanted

    -   You cannot call in favors from an organization that you are
        Wanted by (that is, that you purchased this trait for).

## Special Attacks

-   Any skilled melee combatant will have developed a repertoire of
    useful tricks, more than simply _sticking pointy end in other
    fighter._ We call these _strikes_ and _maneuvers_.

    -   A _strike_ is a modification to a normal attack. To make a
        strike, you take a penalty on your attack; if you score an
        Exceptional Success, in addition to the normal affects of the
        attack, you gain the listed Result.

        -   You decide if your attack is going to be a strike before you
            make it (since you have to take a penalty on the attack).
        -   An attack can only be one kind of Strike. (You can't take a
            \-20 penalty to have an attac be both a Called Shot an Knock
            Down.)

    -   A _maneuver_ isn't made as part of an attack.

        -   Each maneuver will list the type of action required, the
            check, and the result if you succeed.

### Strikes

### Maneuvers

    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Test: Your melee attack skill vs. target's melee attack skill or
        Fray

        them to drop one held item (like a weapon or shield).

        a -20 penalty to their defense.

-   Grabbing

    -   Action: Standard Action
    -   Test: your Unarmed Combat vs. target's Fray or Unarmed Combat.
    -   Result: you grab the opponent, impeding them. They cannot easily
        act.
    -   The results are at the GM's discretion, but normally grabbed
        characters cannot take any other actions besides attempting to
        escape the grab.
    -   A grabbed character can attempt to break a grapple, using either
        their Unarmed Combat or their STR+SOM, versus the Unarmed Combat
        of the character grabbing them. If they win, they break free.

-   Trip

    -   Action: Standard Action
