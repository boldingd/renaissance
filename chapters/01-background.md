## The Green Country

The continent

-   Takes place on large northern-hemisphere continent (the Emerald
    Plain).

    -   Named for how heavily forested it is.
    -   "Forrest\\'s Spine" range in middle, two long plains sloping to
        sea on either side
    -   alt: World's Spine or Worldspine. Need a better name than
        Forrest Spine.

-   Large island chain off to the West (The Haven Isles), of which
    Islandholm is the largest (and Islandholm is very large).

    -   Change from last revision: Haven Isles are a chain, of which
        Islandholme is the largest. Editing is required.

-   Third continent approaching from the South. No land bridge yet,
    large gulf (about 900km); only recently able to cross it.

    -   The Raptor's Plane
    -   Possible geography: heavy jungle in the West and center, desert
        in the East.
    -   might pick a different name referencing their feathers and
        plumage.
    -   The average North-South distance of the Mediterranean sea is
        800km, I used that as a guide. Although I might prefer it to be
        bigger.

-   (I wanted to avoid being Fantasy America or Fantasy Europe right
    from the beginning, so I tried to get geography that didn't line up
    with either. I did an imperfect job.)

## History

Distant History

-   Humans first to build cities, develop settled agriculture
-   Human city-states rise up on shores of rivers, flowing east from
    World's Spine to sea
-   Spread quickly, crossing World's Spine. Penetrate territories of
    other pre-settled races and peoples
-   Humans found an Empire

    -   empire run from and for the three major city-states (all in the
        Eastern-most region of the continent, on rivers flowing from the
        World's Spine to the sea)
    -   "Roman Style": the rest of the Empire is conquered territory,
        administered for the benefit of citizens of the Three Cities.

-   Spreads too far:

    -   distant colonies become as large and prosperous as the Three
        Cities, but too far away to control
    -   Empire sends small populations of its citizens to rule distant
        territories; exports knowledge, culture and language

-   Dragon Karrach leads rebellion. Claims foothills on Eastern side of
    world-spine, cuts off most of the Empire\\'s territory from Three
    Cities (~150 years before first Charter)
-   Former Imperial territory continues to grow, but suffers power
    vacuum.
-   Dawn of the Commonwealth: Gnollish refugees, fleeing a purge in
    their own tribe, seek shelter in a human village, and are granted
    refuge and nearby Manor.

Commonwealth History

-   The charter that granted Gnolls a manor becomes an important
    document governing trade
-   Society benefits from strength of Gnolls
-   Bolstered by Gnolls, patrols secure countryside; trade flourishes,
    more manors founded.

    -   "first charter" is used to administer relations between manors
        and city
    -   it works but is unwieldy -- it was never intended to build the
        government for a nation.

-   Eastern Empire collapses, an event nobody else cares about
-   75 years later, New Charter replaces Old Charter: formally builds
    Charter Council.

    -   New Charter is actually designed as a governing document
    -   Any manor that signs the Charter is a member of the Commonwealth
    -   "league of city-states" type arrangement: each Manor and City is
        still a "law unto itself"
    -   The year the New Charter is signed is Charter Year 0 (CY 0)
    -   Commonwealth Council cannot make law: all they do is tax trade,
        and use money to fund Army and maintain Roads
    -   over next ~700 years, powers and missions expand, but are
        constrained by terms of charter. For example, some public
        schools opened, but run under road-building power, officially
        for the purpose of training engineers to build roads, bridges
        and dams.

-   Expand and flourish: cross World's Spine mountains

    -   other races (mostly) peacefully integrated: the manorial system
        is flexible, they're simple granted manors.
    -   Some Tribal Races refuse to integrate: the Commonwealth simply
        flows around their territories.
    -   This does leave large swathes of unclaimed territories in the
        middle of the continent (the "Tribal Lands", where tribal
        cultures still exist)

-   Feudalism takes root in territories of the Old Empire, Kingdoms
    built

    -   This will give rise to the Kingdoms of Men, a messy web of small
        Kingdoms.

-   First manor on the Western side of the World Spine signs charter in
    CY 91.
-   Dwarves encountered in the North in CY 103.
-   In CY 325, the Western coast is reached; in CY 350, the Haven Isles
    are reached, and Islandholm is settled.
-   CY 350, Karrach surrenders power of nobility, Dragonshire governed
    by "house of commons"
-   In CY 447, Shaded Sea People attack Islandholme and occupy it --
    briefly. Commonwealth counter-attack is devastating, liberating
    island twenty days later and shattering the forces of the houses
    that mounted it.

    -   Surviving Shade Elves are imprisoned in short term, slowly
        integrated into Commonwealth society. Ash elves are their
        descendants

-   CY 600, Kobolds flee genocide in eastern portion of Human Kingdoms;
    peacefully incorporated into Commonwealth

    -   Many settle in World's Spine mountains, many more continue to
        the Haven Isles.

-   CY 750, Commonwealth Compact replaces Commonwealth Charter

    -   The Commonwealth no works like a league of nations.
    -   Commonwealth territory split into Provinces and City-States:

        -   each province organizes itself
        -   city-states are independent of provinces, have their own
            top-level status.

    -   The Commonwealth Council still can't make law, but it has
        broader funding powers -- no longer just armies and civil
        engineers, can now undertake civil projects (like schools)
        directly
    -   Dragonshire formally incorporated as a Province (it was an
        independent allied nation)
    -   Clay Men formally incorporated (where formerly and allied
        people)
    -   Commonwealth Compact has an "enumeration of freedoms" that each
        Province (and each Manor) must provide.

## Commonwealth Today

-   Present Year: CY 830
-   Commonwealth has 4 Provinces (not counting the Tribal Lands)

    -   Heartland: original territory. The World-Spine, some territory
        East, and a large chunk West. Still a network of manors
        internally
    -   The Haven Isles: island chain off the Western coast, featuring
        one large sub-continent island (Islandholm), and several smaller
        islands. A federalized state in the modern sense.
    -   Northland: northern territories occupied by Dwarves, consists
        largely of the Dwarven holds that chose to join the Commonwealth
        (not all did).
    -   Tribal Territories: large swaths of central land-mass left
        un-governed

        -   complex relationship
        -   Not a province, more an Unorganized Territory
        -   Some tribes are Commonwealth members or allies, and some are
            not.

    -   Dragonshire: Territory in the South-East, between Heartland and
        the Kingdoms of Men. Essentially a constitutional monarchy, with
        a parliamentary republican government. Where the dragons are
        from.

-   There are three major city-states

    -   Twin Cities, old (above-ground) trade-city and new Kobold
        underground metropolis, built one-above-the-other in World Spine
        Mountains.
    -   Port City situated on Southern coast of Emerald Plain
    -   Royal City in Dragonshire?

-   The Commonwealth is stable and prosperous

    -   internal trade flourishes, mediated by the river-boats, by
        halfling and human trade caravans, and by sailing along the
        coast.
    -   The Commonwealth Council collects taxes, negotiates with
        external nations, and runs the Council organizations (like the
        Military and the Engineers).

        -   The Council can amend the Compact, although it's hard.
        -   The Council also manages inter-province disputes.
        -   Note that the Council doesn't make law, each province does
            that for themselves.

    -   The Commonwealth is internally stable.

        -   The military keeps the peace.
        -   People identify as Commonwealth citizens; they view this as
            important as racial or provincial identities.

    -   well-funded professional military (internal police, army, navy)

        -   provides a high level of security, and thus enables trade

    -   beginnings of public school system, libraries and museums
    -   well-maintained roads, prosperous internal trade

-   major concern is their neighbors

    -   sustained, bitter cold war with Shade Elf/Plague Rat alliance
    -   unstable states to the North East (Kingdom of Man) and
        South-East (Goblinoid Kingdoms)

-   Some internal corruption still exists

    -   notably in cities, and notably in the Heartland Province

-   Also, the whims of the spirits are a constant source of trouble

    -   I'll admit, originally I wasn't planning on focusing on this,
        but I think it's both more interesting and more flexible than
        the other themes I was going to focus on.

-   As can _other forces_ (Fantasy-era Call of Cthulhu)

## Commonwealth Technology

-   I'm bad at history, but shooting for something-like Europe in
    1200-1400.

    -   I want them to have an impressive cultures, so I might bump that
        target year forward a little.

-   "Dark Ages" innovations occurred in Commonwealth around CY 300-500:

    -   heavy plow, three-field rotation, yoking horses for agriculture

-   (and, of course, they can make steel, ink, paper, brick, masonry,
    ...)
-   Have invented black powder, is used in cannons

    -   man-portable guns don't generally exist, but
    -   GM's could introduce blunderbusses or smooth-bore muzzle-loaders
        without too much disruption

-   Commonly harness natural energy

    -   windmills and water-wheels used to grind grain, pump water

-   Use of steam in heated baths, although not yet as an energy source
    (i.e. steam power)
-   Printing press invented 75 years ago (CY 755), society still
    adjusting from sudden surge in literature

## Commonwealth Life, Society and Economy

-   90% of people are farmers, living in villages of a few hundred
    people.

    -   Most of the other people in these villages are also farmers --
        that is, not artisans, bureaucrats, traders, soldiers or
        priests.
    -   Though the income of these people is marginal, they are not
        serfs---they are not owned by local nobles, at least not in the
        Commonwealth at least.
    -   Many of these people know very little of the outside world, and
        will never be more than half a day's walk from the place they
        were born.
    -   Usefully for these people, the Commonwealth funds traveling
        teachers and medics. While they don't provide anything like a
        modern education system, they do at least guarantee that most
        citizens are literate and numerate, and that they have a sketch
        idea of their own history.
    -   Village farmers usually produce food for their own subsistence,
        and to feed the nearby manor to which they are associated.
    -   Typically populated by a few hundred people, usually of the same
        race (owing mainly to the need to have potential mates). Most
        villages are populated by either humans or gnolls.

-   Manors are large settlements; they are scattered throughout the
    countryside.

    -   Manors are, classically, overseen by a lord or central
        organization; though the Commonwealth has abolished formal
        serfdom, the organizations and lordly manors that founded manors
        often remain powerful and influential within their sphere.
    -   Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be "owned" by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
    -   Manors often host local administrators and priests.
    -   Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
    -   Manors often host traders.
    -   Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
    -   Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor's food production.
    -   Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

-   Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.

    -   Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
    -   Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes---rivers or major overland routes.
    -   Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars---and the lower-class helpers they employ.
    -   Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
    -   Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
    -   Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

-   Major Cities

    -   Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are _major
        cities_.
    -   Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand---sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
    -   Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

-   The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.

    -   Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
    -   Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
    -   Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
    -   The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
    -   Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
    -   Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
    -   Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth's
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

-   Trading Caravans

    -   A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
    -   Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        _dimorphic_: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
    -   Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

-   Underground Societies

    -   Several commonwealth races---notably Kobolds and Ash
        Elves---prefer to live underground.
    -   Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
    -   Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
    -   They also often support large populations of artisans.
    -   They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

-   I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.

## Commonwealth Governance

-   Move/expand above information here.
-   One feature of New Charter is that the Commonwealth can collect
    taxes from its provinces, which the Commonwealth Council can use to
    fund whatever operations they elect to (as opposed to specifically
    funding the patrols and roads under the Compact).

    -   This has lead to several new Commonwealth Council organizations.

-   One major such organization is the military.

    -   The Commonwealth has the known world's preeminent military.
    -   Their prosperity allows them to fund a permanent, professional
        military.
    -   This military actively patrols their interior and guards their
        frontiers.
    -   The security provided by their armed forces allows trade to
        flourish, and the might of their military substantially prevents
        attack by competing societies.
    -   Gnolls are a major race in the Commonwealth military, where
        their physical strength and endurance provide a formidable
        advantage over primarily Human, Shade Elf or Goblinoid armies.
    -   Kobolds have also found a place within the Commonwealth's
        armies, where their speed, tough hides and small size can make
        them useful infiltrators, raiders, scouts and spies.

-   Hmm. This section might be redundant to information in the
    Commonwealth Today and Organizations sections; I might also not want
    to go on at length about this. Possibly rework.

## Commonwealth Magic

Though the spirits are often inscrutable and the potential applications
for magic are vast, it is nevertheless true that the sages and scholars
of the Commonwealth have amassed a vast amount of useful knowledge of
magic, and that much of this knowledge has been deployed to the benefit
of the Commonwealth. It is studied in their universities, deployed in
their military, and sold in their cities by clerics and hedge-wizards.
While powerful magic items (e.g. magical weapons and armor) are rare,
simple magical tools and potions are common (see _Items_ for a few
examples, by no means complete!).

Of special note is the recently-developed Kairne Network. Each Kairne is
an unassuming stack of standing-stones, surrounded by an open space and
paced out by smaller Kairnes arranged in a circle. These unassuming
ritual-sights allow magic-users who know how to use them to rapidly
transport themselves from any one Kairne to any other---allowing them to
cover great distances in the blink of an eye. Presently, only a dozen
Kairnes have been constructed, and the Kairne networks remain difficult
to use---in particular, few mages can carry much with them.

## Other Factions

-   Kingdoms of Man: unstable feudal society to the East, where the
    Empire used to be.

    -   An unstable society, a lot of small human kingdoms tied together
        by a web of noble alliances.
    -   Rife with political intrigue as noble lines and power blocks vie
        for control, plenty of opportunity for adventures!
    -   Roughly divided between the Western portion, which is relatively
        more open and friendly with the Commonwealth, and the Eastern
        part, who are racist, humans-first asshole who would love to do
        as much damage to the Commonwealth as they can.
    -   Militarily overmatched by the Commonwealth, and so they've been
        at an uneasy peace for more than 150 years.

-   Shaded Sea People

    -   Alliance of Ratfolk and Shade Elves.
    -   Shade elves originate in the Southwestern corner of the Emerald
        Plane, where they were a fearsome mounted raiding people.
    -   Ratfolk originate in an island chain 300km off the coast, where
        they where skilled sailors.
    -   Complex history of raiding and violence.
    -   Both Shade Elves and then Ratfolk where forced to pay tribute by
        a third, rarely-encountered people, the Leapers.
    -   They raided each-other to meet the tribute demands, until some
        400 years ago, when they instead allied with each other and
        turned to raiding the Commonwealth.
    -   Their siege of Islandholme in CY 447 is a major turning point;
        their devastating defeat depletes the resources of the houses
        that mounted the attack.
    -   They turned to raiding the Ratfolk who had settled on the
        Raptor's Plane, fleeing their cruel cousins; this ended when
        they allied with the Raptors, and eventually ejected the Shaded
        Sea Peoples from Raptor's Plane.
    -   At present, they are still an active piratical and raiding
        culture, and they still have several "client" populations in the
        Shaded Sea and on Emerald Plane.

-   The Raptor's Alliance

    -   On the Raptor's Plane, in the North-West and Central regions of
        the continent.
    -   An alliance formed almost 400 years ago to resist piracy and
        raiding by Shaded Sea People.
    -   United the Raptors with Ratfolk who had settled on the
        North-West shore, fleeing the cruelty of their cousins.
    -   First contacted 300 years ago, with heavy travel beginning 200
        years ago.
    -   Friendly with the Commonwealth, though independent.
    -   May be forced into closer alliance, as they are pressured by
        Goblins on the Eastern shore and Shaded Sea peoples on the West.

-   Goblin Kings

    -   In South-East of Emerald Plain -- East of Dragonshire, South of
        Kingdoms of Men
    -   also on North-Eastern edge of the Raptor's Plane.
    -   In the past, they were a much bigger threat; the Commonwealth
        and Kingdoms have since grown militarily too powerful, and the
        Goblinoid Kingdoms have been "contained."
    -   Rather than die out, they've crossed the Gulf and begun
        colonizing the island-continent to the South.
    -   There they have subjugated several of the races they've
        encountered, and have begun to become wealthy.

    -   Supports specialized artisans, merchants, bureaucrats,
        academics.

## Organizations

-   Commonwealth Council organizations

    -   Council Army / Navy / patrols
    -   Council Architects: originally built and maintained roads and
        bridges, now also responsible for many large public works (f.ex.
        Dams)
    -   Council Colleges: directly fund and run several colleges in
        larger towns, pay for traveling teachers to visit smaller
        communities.
    -   Council Mediators: help to settle disputes between provinces;
        disputes ultimately voted on by Commonwealth Council.

-   Professional guilds

    -   Professional guilds are a major part of the Commonwealth
        economy!
    -   Guilds provide support to tradesmen and professionals.
    -   Guilds require dues from members, and work to make sure that
        members aren't cheating the public.
    -   Guilds provide support to members, helping place apprentices
        with them, and helping them make connections to other
        professionals as they travel.

-   Religious orders

    -   usually polytheistic, help hook mortal supplicants up with any
        spirit who will make a deal
    -   since spirits are usually regional, temples usually specialize
        in spirits in the region
    -   some are devoted to pursuit of an idea, c.f. most orders that
        produce "paladins" or something like them

-   criminal organizations

    -   corruption does exist, especially in big cities
    -   Smugglers, black-mails, thugs, thieves, and everything else.

## Languages

Language Outline and Rules

-   Commonwealth is wide, travel is slow; also, many tribes
    interspersed. Therefore:

    -   many different regional languages
    -   Complicated by the fact that not all races can speak
        each-others' language (c.f. Gnolls and Humans cannot make the
        same sounds, and thus cannot speak each-others\\' languages)

-   Language Groups:

    -   Each language belongs to a _language group _(which represents
        the sounds needed to speak it);
    -   likewise, each race (that can talk) will have one (or more)
        language group(s) (that represent the sounds they can _make_).
    -   You can learn any language (that is, put ranks into it). You can
        understand, read and write any language you know._ But, _you can
        only _speak_ a language if it is one of your race's language
        groups.
    -   So a human (group HHED) can master Heartland Gnollish (group
        GR); they will be able to understand, read and write that
        language, but they still won't be able to speak it.
    -   But, see also the Torque of Speaking (check name) in the Magic
        Items section.

-   It is actually fairly common for people in combined communities to
    be able to understand languages that they cannot speak (that is, to
    have ranks in languages not in their language group)

    -   C.F. in a combined Human and Gnollish community, many people
        might be able to understand both the local Human and Gnollish
        languages, even though Gnolls can only _speak_ the gnollish one
        and humans can only _speak_ the human one.

-   Some Common Language Groups:

    -   HHED: the sounds that humans, halflings, elves and dwarves can
        make
    -   GR: the sounds that Gnolls and Ratfolk can make (commonly
        described as "several coyotes having seizures")
    -   DDK: the sounds that Dragons, Drakes and Kobolds can make
        (commonly described as "a rasping song-bird")

-   10 ranks in a language is enough to assume that you can communicate
    basic concepts, given time.

    -   (NB: this is why all major characters get 10 ranks in
        Commonwealth Standard, see Character Construction.)

Some Common Languages

-   Commonwealth Standard

    -   Group: Any
    -   Attempt at a universal language
    -   Spoken language uses a small set of abstract sounds, designed to
        be very distinct. Each race picks their own sounds (which they
        can make) to use for each abstract sound.
    -   At-best-kind-of works (Language checks for spoken Commonwealth
        Standard are at -10)
    -   Commonwealth Standard as a _written_ language is a huge success.
    -   Commonwealth Standard is the almost-universal written language
        for governing documents, contracts, trade -- even in the
        Kingdoms of Man, many merchants and administrators can read and
        write Commonwealth Standard.
    -   Most formal education uses texts in Commonwealth Standard, and
        therefore
    -   more people can _read and write_ in Commonwealth Standard than
        in their own language's script
    -   No-one has Commonwealth Standard as a first language. Most
        people will have their own regional, racial language as a first
        language, and then possibly ranks in other common regional
        languages (so they can understand their neighbors) and possibly
        ranks in Commonwealth Standard

-   Goblin: language used throughout the Goblin Kingdoms

    -   Group HHED+GR (requires both to speak)

-   Heartland Gnoll: a derivative of the language spoke by the Gnoll
    tribe that helped found the Commonwealth. Has absorbed many idioms
    from Weal.

    -   Though Heartland Gnoll is far and away the most common GR
        language, many other tribal languages still survive in pockets.
    -   Group GR

-   Hel: common language in Northland, influenced by both Hud and Weal.

    -   Group HHED

-   High Kobold: language used by Kobolds in the Commonwealth.

    -   Derived from Old Kobold, but has become far more complex, and
        has imported words directly from Rak, and idioms from Weal and
        Islander Elvish.
    -   Group DDK

-   Hud: traditional Dwarven language, common in Northland Province.

    -   Group HHED

-   Islander Elvish: commonly spoke by the Ash Elves living on Haven
    Isle

    -   Group HHED

-   Islander: common language on the Haven Isles, influenced by Islander
    Elvish and Weal.

    -   Group HHED

-   Rak: language spoken by Dragons and Drakes in the Dragonshire

    -   Group DDK

-   Royal: Common language in the Kingdoms of Men.

    -   Derived form Imperial
    -   Group HHED

-   Weal: common language in Heartland Province.

    -   Derived from Imperial, but heavily influenced by the languages
        of other races from the interior of the continent.
    -   Group HHED

-   Old Imperial: the language that the Empire carried east.

    -   The language spoken by most Humans east of the World-Spine is
        derived from this -- but it's not a modern, living language.
    -   Notable for its aspirated H's and hard consonants.
    -   Group HHED

-   Old Kobold: original Kobold language, spoken in their ancestral home
    in Imperial territory.

## Magic

Magic runs throughout the world of the Commonwealth; it is produced and
consumed in countless ways, and bent to numerous ends.

All processes---especially life processes---produce a spiritual essence,
which is simply called _magic_. Get a better name. This energy can be
harnessed and put to use---although this can be difficult, given that it
is fickle and unpredictable, often following arbitrary and bizarre
rules, or operating according to no apparent law at all.

Some can learn to manipulate the magic that arises and flows around
them, producing powerful magical effects; these people are called mages,
and the powerful abilities they perfect are called spells. Others learn
to manipulate the magical energies that they produce within themselves,
granting them supernatural physical and mental abilities; these are
_psions_, and their powers are called _sleights_. Some creatures anatomy
even incorporates the presence of magic, giving them innate magical
abilities; we say these creatures are _empowered_. Sometimes, these
energies form into beings made completely of magic; we call these
Spirits (see _Spirits, _below). Some flesh-and-blood beings serve
Spirits---or broker deals with them; these are referred to as _priests_,
and any abilities or gifts the spirits grant them are called _boons_.

Magic can also be incorporated into the functions of devices, or infused
into solutions, allowing for magical tools, artifacts and potions to be
produced; the Commonwealth makes great use of simple magical devices and
potions, while extremely powerful magical artifacts are rare, highly
prized, and almost always unique.

Creatures are classified as either _natural, empowered _or _spirit_,
based on their relationship to magic; see _Characters_ and _Races_.
Powers are classified as _sleights_, _spells, _or _boons_ based on what
skill they rely on, from which we infer what source of magic that they
use (or as something else, like a maneuver, if they don't use a magical
source); see _Powers_.

## Spirits

Spirits are real and present things in the world of the
Commonwealth---to the point that you can walk directly up to them and
speak to them, although doing so can be difficult and dangerous.

Sometimes, magic forms into creatures, whether by binding to inert
matter to bring it to life, or by forming into creatures made entirely
of magical energy alone. Some such organisms are simple, analogous to
animals, while others are sophisticated, having minds equal to
flesh-and-blood beings. Some are even greater beings; immense, powerful
and mysterious, these are known as ~~Patrons~~ Great Spirits.

Spirit creatures are fueled by the energies they siphon from a
particular region or process, called their Basin. Sometimes, a Basin is
a place, like a lake or forest; sometimes, it is a large region, like
the World-Spine mountains. Sometimes it is a set of places holy to them,
which might be as broadly-construed as "all forges" or as specific as
"the spot where Lyn was slain." Other times, Basins are processes: such
as music, for example, or decay, or fire. In turn, many spirits also
have the ability to influence their Basin, granting them supernatural
abilities.

Spirit creatures are populous, almost as much so as natural creatures.
Spirit creatures frequently align themselves into clans and nations,
much like natural creatures do---with the additional complication
introduced by being bound to specific basins, which can make some
alliances tense and some conflicts inevitable.

Some Spirits are mercurial, hiding behind religions and refusing to
interact directly with flesh-and-blood beings; others, however, are very
direct, presenting themselves directly to mortals and dealing plainly
with them. (And, of course, a great many spirits have no concern for
mortal affairs at all, dealing only with other spirits.)

## Propitiation

Some spirits can be _propitiated_---that is, they will do favors for
mortals that perform certain rituals or make certain offerings; we call
these spirits Patrons. As in all other things, the wants of Patrons vary
widely; some will grant simple favors in exchange for offerings of food
or song, others might demand elaborate ritual, while still others might
command much higher prices---life, treasure or blood. (Note that only
some Spirits can be propitiated; others have no particular concern for
the affairs of Natural beings---or simply don't have any useful ability
to offer.) (Making a deal with a spirit that cannot be Bound can be
dangerous; see _Binds_, below.)

To some extent, priests in Renaisance work much like brokers: they
decipher the intricate and complex details of the wants, natures and
politics of nearby Spirits, and connect flesh-and-blood supplicants to
Spirits with whom they can do business.

## Manifestations

-   many spirits dwell in or near their basin (esp. if it\\'s a region)

    -   that is, in the physical world, and not in some other "realm"
    -   may not physically manifest, however; they are diffuse in the
        basin
    -   may have specific form they can take

-   some spirits have holy places where they can appear
-   some spirits are connected to physical forms, and can travel about
    much like a natural creature (see f.ex. Shamblers and Tempters)
-   the dead are an exception. Dead creatures pass into a realm of
    Shade. Some specific spirits also exist in the realm of Shade
    normally.

## Saints

Some mortals can form special relationships with existing spirits; these
mortals are sometimes granted places as Spirits after death (as opposed
to passing into the Realm of the Dead). In principle, the
formerly-mortal Spirit then works like any other Spirit, and can act as
a free agent; Saint refers specifically to those spirits that remain
loyal to some other Spirit\\'s cause. In practice, most Spirits do not
"sanctify" a mortal recklessly, and so most Saints remain loyal to their
Spirit\\'s cause.

Saints frequently do not have happy histories.

## Binds

Binds are a major part of bargaining with the Spirits. They are also
almost a complete mystery.

A _bind_ is a ritual that exerts control over a spirit; theoretically, a
bound spirit can be compelled to act in a certain way, such as
performing a service (or not doing something).

Only some Spirits have (known) binds, and any two spirits are likely to
have entirely different binds.

Binds are terribly understood. There is no known way to tell if a spirit
is bound -- or learn what its bind is, or tell if it even has one. Only
a few spirits have known Binds at all -- some skeptics even maintain
that binds do not exist -- that they are simply acts put forth to lull
mortals into trusting Spirits.

Binds can vary widely. Some require a spirit to consent to being bound
in order to be effective, while others do not. Some are simple, like
speaking a short phrase in a spirit\\'s presence, while others are quite
complex, involving elaborate ceremonies or complex rituals. Likewise,
their effects and durations can vary wildly -- from compelling a spirit
to keep vigil until relieved, to preventing a spirit from lying until
the dawn, to binding a spirit to serve until released, to preventing a
spirit from touching anything orange for a week. Making things even more
complex, binds can have bizarre failure-cases and exceptions---a bind
might not work if the candles used in the ritual are made from the fat
of a mother goat and its foal, for example, or a bind might break if a
given spirit crosses running water.

Needless to say, keeping track of which spirits have known binds, how
those binds work and, importantly, if those binds have any "gotchas" is
a major and valuable occupation for the Clergy!

    -   Taken hostage and tortured.
    -   Freed during counter-attack, went to front lines; attacked and

    -   Great Spirit and patron; it is a tribal spirit, who chooses its
        favored people, and they become its Basin.
    -   It can grant them strength, but it demands their devotion---and
        that they maintain their place as its chosen.
    -   It usually selects the strongest people, by some definition---at
        least among those who seek its favor. Sometimes it will shift
        its favor if a people becomes too weak.
    -   Sometimes no obvious reason why its favor shifts.
    -   Temples and worship sites center a gold or bronze statue,
        representing an ideal, heroic vision of the people in question.

        alike, dwells deep beneath the northern edge of the World-Spine
        Mountains; they are his Basin.
    -   Pays no heed to mortals; goes about his own business, for his
        own reasons. Is uninterested in mortal affairs, and cannot be
        propitiated.
    -   When his affairs intersect with those of mortals, the results
        are mystifying, without rhyme or reason, or apparent
        motivation---and, because he is a strong spirit with a vast
        basin, the consequences for mortals are often profound.

-   The Cypress

    -   Great Spirit dwelling in the swamps and marshes in the
        south-western lowlands, which are his Basin.
    -   He likes mortals, and is happy to share his land with them.
    -   A complex spirit: as a Spirit associated with nature, he demands
        that his lands be preserved; however, as a social creature, he
        enjoys interacting with mortal beings.
    -   He believes that it's possible for society to expand without
        destroying nature, and seeks to preserve such a balance.
    -   Father of the Shamblers, see below.

## Death

Most who die pass on into the Realm of Shade, a dark and immaterial
place of which mortals know little. There is no known record of any of
the living entering or viewing it; while the spirits of the dead can be
coaxed back from it, they are frequently uncooperative. When the dead
manifest in the material world, they are frequently changed from their
former selves: they are beyond all mortal concern and consequence, and
are often aggressive, vulgar and destructive.

Investigation is further hampered because it is difficult to conjure the
spirits of the dead; it often requires the complicity of powerful
spirits to accomplish. In particular, summoning the spirit of a
_particular_ deceased mortal can prove extraordinarily tricky, without a
close personal connection to the departed or the aid of a power Spirit;
those who attempt to summon the dead without one or both run the risk of
calling forth some unrelated deceased, whose only concern might be to
cause as much chaos as they can.

Some mortals have never been successfully summoned, despite repeated
attempts made by expert Clerics; it is assumed---or perhaps hoped---that
some happier fate than departure to the realm of Shade has claimed these
beings, and that they simply do not wish to return.

I need to work on this some. I'm not sure I want the setting to have a
final fate that's this bleak, but there are elements of it that I like
and that I want to keep.

## What you do

This needs to go somewhere else.

-   You won\\'t:

    -   raid ancient temples for artifacts: modern knowledge eclipses
        anything of past ages
    -   slay bands of robbers: large and well-funded Commonwealth
        military keeps large bandit problems from cropping up -- most of
        the time, at least
    -   slay monsters: most "monsters" are your neighbors, and the ones
        that aren\\'t, the military deals with

-   You might:

    -   venture into neighboring kingdoms under cover to keep them from
        threatening you
    -   deal with local city-crime problems (gangs, the mob, or
        government corruption)
    -   deal with local tragedies in the Heartland (manors are allowed
        to collapse if they fuck up: Heartland is a little like Fantasy
        Extropia)
    -   Deal with problems caused by troublesome (or mysterious, or
        brutal) spirits
