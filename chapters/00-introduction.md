title: Introduction
---

Right now, I'm still play-testing and revising it---basically it's in
Alpha stages of development. As such, it's a bullet list, with
crossed-out sections and developer notes.

Editing Notes:

-   I need to go through and use the term Tag consistently. And then
    also re-work most entries to use Tags.
-   I'm trying to use "the character" or "a character" consistently, to
    emphasize that players and NPCs use the same rules. I need to go
    back and edit this to be the case.
-   I'm trying to use "they" in cases where gender is unknown or
    unspecified. I _really hate_ the "pick an arbitrary gender" writing
    style that many d20 systems use.
-   I'd like to use lower-case for race names ("orc" and "elf" instead
    of "Orc" and "Elf." I was using caps for a long while tho, so much
    editing will be required.)
-   At least for now, I've decided on just calling it _magic_. I wanted
    to use something a little fancier, like _essence_, but I couldn't
    come up with something I wanted to commit to. I'm using the terms
    _mage_ and _spell,_ _psion_ and _sleight_, and _priest_ and _boon_.
    I may revisit this.
    -   I've specifically avoided using "arcane" as a description,
        because it annoys me that a generation of grognards are growing
        up who think that that word means "knowledge magic" and don't
        realize that it actually just means "difficult secret."

Feedback Questions

-   I think the skill list is near its final state, but any further
    feedback is appreciated.
-   Races, especially race balance, and good features for some of the
    races! Some of the races are pretty boring, compared to drakes and
    kobolds!
-   Likewise, powers and power balance! We need better coverage in
    traits, classes, items and powers.
-   The two-weapon fighting rules are complex, and haven't been
    exercised much. Feedback would be appreciated. If anyone can come up
    with a way to make them simpler without making them worse, that'd be
    good!
-   Likewise, the touch- and indicate-only rules are a snarl, and any
    feedback or suggestions for improvement would be appreciated.
-   Changes to how sustains work. You used to loose a quick action for
    having any active sustains, but that made the turn cycle too
    annoying; now you just take a -10 penalty for each sustain beyond
    the first. Any thoughts on which way is better, or if there's a
    better third option?
-   Feedback on the new Using Magic block.

    -   Do you have a good enough feel for the kind of things you can
        do?
    -   Is it a GM's nightmare (Sauce)?

-   Feedback on making combat maneuvers a "recommended optional rule"?

Contributors:

-   Sauce: a list of powers!
-   SeaVea: fort design, feedback on armor and weapons.
-   King K: the Gnomes, Drugs, help with rep networks.
-   Sinestro: stealth powers, giving the barter system a good exercise.
    Reworking the Orcs.
-   Misandry: helping to fill out the Shamblers.
-   Runic: clever uses for fireballs. Lobsters!

The setting is an attempt to bring a little bit of Roddenberry-esque
multi-cultural optimism to fantasy role-playing; owing to its Eclipse
Phase heritage, it has also proved to support cosmic horror fairly well.

I also want it to feel like the plausible history and current state of a
complete other world. This means that it needs to be historically
plausible, at least by comparison to (for example) "Points of Light,"
the default Pathfinder setting, which includes everything from the
perpetual French revolution to the Russian steppes to strange
techno-magic warring desert robots. At the same time, I don't want to
line up with any existing culture or region too closely; this isn't
re-branded Earth, it's a whole other world, evolving and developing
under entirely different circumstances.

Finally, instead of looking back, I want to look forward: it's not the
story of a culture bravely picking up the pieces of a long-lost empire,
rather it's the story of a prosperous people on the cusp of
renaissance---or, as Runic pointed out, a "Naissance," since they're the
first major culture on their world---whose major opponents are other
unstable states, common corruption, and cosmic forces beyond mortal
ken---at least for now.
