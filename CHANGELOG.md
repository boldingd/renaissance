# Version 4.1

-   Skills
    -   Collapsed Academics and Interest into Knowledge.
    -   Added more tags to many skills.
    -   Added descriptive text, use clarifications and example fields to
        several skills.
    -   Removed Investigate (added a hint to use Profession: Detective
        in the Corner Cases block).
-   Classes / Traits / Powers
    -   Added corpse-buddy classes
    -   Added armor bonuses to Master and Transcend, which where
        otherwise a little lackluster.
    -   Renamed the Cleric and Wizard classes to Priest and Mage,
        respectively.
-   Guns as an optional rule
    -   I reduced the damage that slugs and shot do, but scour still
        does 2d10/turn to anyone coated. Scour on, rat queen.
-   Moved the maneuver system to an alternate rule, with a blue-block in
    the combat rules pointing to it. (So it's a _highly recommended_
    optional rule.)
-   Added a section on using magical rituals to create powerful, one-off
    magical effects.
    -   It has short guidelines for powerful spells for mages, powerful
        trances for psions and summoning powerful spirits for priests.
-   Items
    -   copied over throwing knives, slow-fall cape
    -   added short staff
-   Added "Unusual Movement" as a movement mode.
    -   This change is borrowed from EP2, and is used to "canonize" that
        you can do "all kinds of crazy tricks" when you move.
    -   ...and then I decided to rename it "stunt" because I think that
        might be more evocative of how it's actually supposed to be
        used.
-   Re-wrote the Orc's background, copied the orcs over. (Let me know if
    this works for you, Sinestro.)
-   Hastily dashed off more info on Wood Elves for King K. (Sorry I kind
    of half-assed it, I really needed to get this version out. Let me
    know if this works for you, King K, and any improvements you care to
    make would be appreciated.)
-   Reworded the advancing block to be a little clearer.
-   Added Reputations as alternate rules (King K suggested this, and I
    thought it was a good idea).
-   Added (very short!) optional rules for buying back negative traits.
-   Moved the Skill List section to be before the Character Creation
    Rules section.
