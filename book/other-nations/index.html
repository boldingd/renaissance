        <h2 id="TheKingdomsofMen"><a class="header-link" href="#TheKingdomsofMen">The Kingdoms of Men</a></h2>
<p>The Kingdoms of Men are a human nation that lies to the northeast of the Dragonshire; it arose from the ashes of the Empire of Man more than a century after it had collapsed.</p>
<aside class="floating">
<p>A feudal society, composed of many (mostly-)Human kingdoms tied together by a complex web of custom, alliance and treaty.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="MajorCharacterKassAhnaffHighKing"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCharacterKassAhnaffHighKing">Major Character: Kass Ahnaff, High King</a></h4>
<p>Kass Ahnaff is the current High King.
He has ties of business and noble bond throughout the Dragonshire, and trade with the Commonwealth has made him wealthy.
He supports a closer alliance with the Commonwealth, even to the point of allowing non-Humans to purchase land and do business in the Kingdoms (he might say that it certainly doesn't seem to have hurt the Commonwealth much).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Commonwealth Council would much rather see Kass Ahnaff on the Kingdoms' throne than any of his nearest competitors, and are investing heavily in making sure that he stays there.</p>
<p>His throne is in Merchentmen City (below).</p>
<h4 id="MajorCharacterMelaTennaKing"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCharacterMelaTennaKing">Major Character: Mela, Tenna King</a></h4>
<p>Mela Tenna is the current king of the Kingdom of Tennec; his throne is in Hate's Hold (below).
He is the most powerful Eastern King, and the de facto head of their movement.</p>
<p>He has openly declared his hatred of all non-Humans—including the Haffa, as well as every Human citizen of the Commonwealth, whom he views as traitors.
(He utterly loathes Kass Ahnaff, who he views as the greatest race-traitor in the Kingdoms.)
He has led a series of bloody purges of any remaining non-Humans in the Kingdom of Tenna; he promises similar purges in the entire Kingdoms of Men should he attain the Throne, to be followed by a war of annihilation on the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>He has recently become a devotee of the One who Chose Us.</p>
<p>If anyone is unambiguously evil, it's Mela Tenna.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="MajorCityMerchentmenCity"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCityMerchentmenCity">Major City: Merchentmen City</a></h4>
<p>Known as Annhallan in Royal and Merchentmen City in Commonwealth Standard, this city of 900,000 sits in the northwest of the Kingdoms, about 140 <em>demarc</em> [roughly 588 kilometers] from the border with the Dragonshire, sitting scarcely a <em>demarc</em> from the coast of the Glass Sea.
Annhallan is the capital city of the Kingdom of Anaff; since Kass Anaff is the current High King, the city is currently also the center of government for the Kingdoms of Men.</p>
<p>As the name Merchentmen City implies, the Kingdom of Anaff has long prospered by trade, especially with the Commonwealth; traders from Heartland Province and the Dragonshire are common, and many of hte Commonwealth's languages are spoken in Merchentmen City.</p>
<h4 id="MajorCityHatesHold"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCityHatesHold">Major City: Hate's Hold</a></h4>
<p>Called Tenlan in Royal, Hate's Hold is the capital of the Kingdom of Tennec; it is a city of 800,000 in the southeast of the Kingdoms.
It lies on a river, less than two <em>demarc</em> [8km] up-river from the the coast of the Glass Sea, and a mere 160 <em>demarc</em> [672km] from the open ocean.</p>
<p>With convenient river access to the Glass Sea, Tenlan is a wealthy trade town; their wealth and power are bolstered by a system of weirs and water-channels that water the surrounding territory, which they control and charge for access to.
The Tenna are among the wealthiest (and most convicted) of the royal families of the East; as such, Tenlan is the unofficial capital of the Eastern Kings.</p>
<p>Tenlan is also the center of the worship of the One who Chose Us in the Eastern Kingdoms.</p>
<p>The city is called Hate's Hold for a reason; it is not a good place to be if you aren't Human.</p>
<h4 id="MajorCityTheFirstThrone"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCityTheFirstThrone">Major City: The First Throne</a></h4>
<p>Called Hanman in Royal (and Old Imperial), First Throne is one of the Three Cities that came together to found the Old Empire.
Though it is still a large and prosperous city—situated on the large River Hanem, it has always been a center of trade—it is no longer a center of power within the Kingdoms.
It has a population of 350,000.</p>
<p>The name First Throne is not figurative: the first and oldest-known cities where founded by Humans; though Hanman is not one of these oldest cities, it is believed to be the first city to hold a <em>throne</em>—to develop a regional government.</p>
<p>The city is in the Kingdom of Enha, although the Enhan Kings are relatively weak; the city is ruled by the Hanman Congress.
So far, both the Enhan line and the Hanman Congress have been content to cooperate (for the most part), and enjoy the prosperity that comes from their prominent location and rich trade.
The Enhan Kings are allies of the Annhallan and the Western Kings; the Hanman Congress are divided.
A plurality are supporters of the Western Kings, but other blocs support the Certan cause, direct Commonwealth alliance and the Eastern Kings, in roughly that order of size.</p>
<h4 id="MajorCityCerta"><a class="header-link" href="#MajorCityCerta">Major City: Certa</a></h4>
<p>Certa is a city of 650,000; located roughly in the middle of the Kingdoms of Men, it is the center of the Certan Movement, an anti-monarchist movement.
Certa has been rebuilt on the site of an older (and smaller) city; the city was destroyed more than a century ago, and was claimed by the Certanis and rebuilt some 38 years later—62 years ago.</p>
<p>The city is roughly circular; it is divided into pie-slice-shaped districts by prominent roads that run from the central administrative district to the outer wall.
The city is built with a distinctive, modern architectural style; the buildings are built high, supported by free-standing buttresses, and are decorated with wide windows and prominent artwork.</p>
<p>The Certanis are described in more detail below.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="LanguageRoyal"><a class="header-link" href="#LanguageRoyal">Language: Royal</a></h4>
<p>Royal is the language of the Kingdoms of Men.
Like Weal, it is distantly derived from Old Imperial, the language of the Empire of Man, but almost a thousand years have passed since the two languages began to diverge, and they are now quite dissimilar.</p>
<p><em>Group HHED</em></p>
</aside>
<p>They are Kingdoms in more than name alone; the society consists of a
large number of local nobles, tied together in a complex web of
allegiances.  At present, there are 23 kings as such, more than 35 independent landed nobles (though some of their territories are no larger than a town), and more than a hundred noble families besides.</p>
<p>The allegiances that bind the Kingdom together are very fragile; they can shift, form and break all too quickly.
Because of this, the Kingdoms' politics can be incredibly treacherous, as different power-blocks jostle for control.</p>
<p>Only sometimes can one King credibly claim rulership over all (or just
<em>enough</em>) of the Kingdoms to claim the title of High King---and such a High King's rule is often tenuous, as they will never be without enemies, rivals and usurpers.</p>
<p>There have been three High Kingships in the Kingdoms' history.
There first High Kingship lasted from CY 255 to CY 281; this short-lived dynasty collapsed 10 years after passing form its founder to its first heir, rent apart by an internal power struggle. The second High Kingship lasted from CY 361 to CY 435; these High Kings were substantially more warlike, and were in constant conflict with both the Dragonshire to their east and the Goblin Kings to their South.  The second Kingship collapsed after a series of disastrous military adventures between CY 429-CY 433.  The third High Kingship began in CY 695, and has lasted to the present day.  This High Kingship had good relations with the Dragonshire, and now has good relations with the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Kingdoms can be roughly divided between their western and eastern halves.  The western Kingdoms are relatively open; they have benefited heavily from trade with the Commonwealth, and have little interest in conflict with their wealthy and powerful neighbor.  Unsurprisingly, the present High King hails from a city-state in the western Kingdoms.</p>
<p>The eastern Kingdoms are far more cruel; the Three Cities that built the Empire lie in the eastern portion, and to this day many of the residents there are quick to believe that humans should hold dominion over all other races (and that those whose ancestors built the Empire should hold dominion over all other humans).</p>
<p>The current High King is one Kass Ahnaff, who is the king of the city-kingdom of Annhallan (styled as Wise Westking and Merchentmen City in Common).
Merchentmen City is in the Western Kingdoms;.
Kass has enthusiastically pursued better relations with the Commonwealth, and has made only the barest pretense to disguise his willingness to cooperate with the Commonwealth to combat the nobles of the East who would see him deposed.
Many easterners view Kass as the worst human being alive.</p>
<h3 id="TheKingdomsEconomy"><a class="header-link" href="#TheKingdomsEconomy">The Kingdoms' Economy</a></h3>
<p>The Kingdoms are a relatively wealthy and sophisticated society, particularly in the West, where they have benefited heavily with trade with first the Dragonshire, and later the entire Commonwealth.
During the peace that has prevailed between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms since CY 695, merchants have crossed the borders between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms, enriching communities on both sides; notably, rivers running east from the Worldspine give Commonwealth merchants easy access to the many ports on the Glass Sea, the large inland sea that separates the Kingdoms of Men from the Goblin Empire.</p>
<p>Knowledge also crosses the border, as scholars and innovations from the Dragonshire often cross into the Kingdoms, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this thriving trade does put strain on the east-west divide within the Kingdoms; Commonwealth traders seldom venture into the Eastern Kingdoms, and so the wealth produced by trade is concentrated in the west.</p>
<h3 id="OtherRaces"><a class="header-link" href="#OtherRaces">Other Races</a></h3>
<p>The Kingdoms of Men is a government of men, in their traditional territories; with few exceptions, they have not treated with the other races that may have dwelt within their borders, and instead have displaced them; any that remain are not recognized and citizens, but can only ever be subjects of the Kingdoms.</p>
<p>There is one notable exception; the Kingdom of Haffa in the northwest.  Elves and humans are nearly unique in that they are able to interbreed, although these hybrids are usually sterile (and often suffer other ailments); the half-human, half-elven population of much of Haffa, including the noble line that rules the kingdom, are exceptions to this rule---they are not sterile, and do not commonly suffer any other ailment from their mixed blood.  (It is rumored that magical intervention may have been required to achieve this; whether this is true---and if so, what that intervention was, or what price was likely paid---has been lost to history.)</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Haffa are enemies-by-necessity of the Eastern Kingdoms, who view them as mongrels and half-breeds at best; the Haffa are strong supporters of the current High King and his line.  Notably, though, they usually have no special affinity for tribal Elves living within the Commonwealth's borders, and to the west of the Worldspine.</p>
<p>A particularly grim moment in the history of the Kingdoms' relations with an attempt launched in the Eastern Kingdoms to exterminate their indigenous Kobold population; this led to a mass exodus of Kobolds from the entire Kingdoms.  A few scant pockets of Kobold populations remain in the Western Kingdoms; some settled in the Dragonshire, owing partly to their ability to speak the Drakes' language; far larger number settled deep under the Worldspine; and many more still continued on to the Haven Isles.  In the Commonwealth, Kobolds have prospered and become numerous; this is not the least of the reasons that the Commonwealth views the Eastern Kingdoms as their enemy.</p>
<h3 id="TheMilitary"><a class="header-link" href="#TheMilitary">The Military</a></h3>
<p>Rapid improvements in the quality and availability of steel plate armor---in both the Kingdoms and the Dragonshire---have been the major driver of military tactics in the Kingdoms.  The Kingdoms have sophisticated-enough metallurgy that they can produce large numbers of weapons and armors made of high-quality steel, but they cannot produce it on the scale that the Commonwealth can, and so steel plate armor in particular remains primarily the province of knights (who are often drawn from the ranks of the noble and the wealthy).</p>
<p>Knights are among the most iconic of the Kingdoms' combatants; horse-mounted human Knights in full plate are mobile, heavily-armored and difficult to strike, making them a devastating force on the battlefield.  Many of the kingdoms have long traditions of horse-back riding and archery; because of this, besides mounted Knights, the Kingdoms can boast large numbers of skilled light cavalry and archers---especially masters of the devastating-though-difficult longbow.  In recent years, however, the prominence of longbow archers has fallen away, as the Kingdoms now commonly arms its peasant infantry with easy-to-use and powerful crossbows.</p>
<p>In its early years, each noble and each kingdom was responsible for contributing to the Kingdoms' military from their own resources; though the Kingdoms where often capable of fielding a large and effective army, they could suffer from inconsistent standards of equipment, composition and discipline.  One innovation achieved during the interregnum between the Second and Third High Kings was a standardization of the kinds of combatants that each kingdom was expected to furnish.  Though the <em>enforcement</em> of these standards is still subject to the Kingdoms' internal politics, their military is nevertheless far more consistent and unified today than it has been in centuries past.</p>
<p>The Kingdoms typically view their Knights as their most elite and powerful combatants, and they are typically the centerpiece of their military strategy.  After the Knights, their light cavalry and archers are their most prominent forces.  They often field a small number of professional infantry, who they place at the front of their lines, and support with larger numbers of mercenaries, mustered peasants and even conscripted prisoners; unsurprisingly, the discipline, morale and effectiveness of the last two categories can vary widely.</p>
<p>Though not a fact that is often spoken aloud---especially in the Eastern Kingdoms---the Kingdoms of Men are entirely militarily overmatched by the Commonwealth.  Though the Commonwealth cannot boast the large number of Knights that the Kindgoms can, the Commonwealth is richer, has better access to steel, is <em>much</em> larger, has a much larger professional military, and can draw on the much greater physical strength of Gnolls and Drakes.</p>
<p>The Kingdoms, however, <em>are</em> a match for their neighbor to the south, the Goblin Empire, which led the Goblins in years past to sail south from the Emerald Plane and seek riches (and weaker opponents) on the Ruby Plane.  This influx of wealth (and new source of fighting experience for their infantry), however, has led to a significant improvement in the Goblin Empire's military; this in turn has not escaped the notice of the Kingdoms of Men.</p>
<h3 id="OtherNations"><a class="header-link" href="#OtherNations">Other Nations</a></h3>
<p>At present, the Kingdoms of Men are at peace with the Commonwealth, and are not at war with the Goblin Empire.
The High King has fostered good relations with the people of the Commonwealth, and the people of the Western Kingdom have prospered from it.
This state of affairs is precarious, however, as many within the Eastern Kingdoms would dearly love to seize the throne---and thereafter to reclaim long-lost territories from the Dragonshire, to lay the Commonwealth and the Goblin Empire low, and to restore humanity to preeminence in the land east of the Worldspine.</p>
<p>They could never achieve this on their own, however, even <em>if</em> they could command the undisputed loyalty of all the kings and nobles of the Kingdoms of Men; therefore, the nobles of the East are searching for allies.</p>
<p>The rulers of the West are not ignorant of this---the kings of the far east are seldom subtle in their contempt for non-humans---and so they are seeking allies, too.  And so, the struggle for rule of the Kingdoms of Men has become something of a proxy war between all the great powers of the continent.</p>
<p>If the Easterners can seize control of the Kingdoms, and if they strike an alliance with the Goblin Empire and the Shaded Sea Peoples---even a temporary one---then the Commonwealth is doomed; if, however, the current high-king can solidify his control, then an alliance with the Commonwealth is a possibility---and should that happen, the Shaded Sea People and the Goblinoid Empire would in turn be hopelessly outmatched.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Commonwealth and the Western Kingdoms, a nightmare alliance between the Shaded Sea People, the Goblins and the Eastern Kingdoms seems unlikely; the Human and Goblin nations have a long history of conflict, and the Shaded Sea People have no significant contact with either; what's more, the Eastern Kingdom's obvious contempt for non-humans would make such an alliance difficult to strike (and impossible to sustain).</p>
<aside class="floating hook">
<p>The internal politics of the Kingdoms of Men are one of the major conflicts that drives the plot of Renaissance, and are a major source of plot hooks; the fate of the known world rests in the balance, and there's plenty of room for assassinations, blackmail, dirty tricks and secrets to make a difference!</p>

<h3 id="TheCertanMovement"><a class="header-link" href="#TheCertanMovement">The Certan Movement</a></h3>
<p>The Certan Movement is an anti-monarchist movement centered in the city of Certa.
Though centered in the city of the same name, they have risen in power and prestige; they have claimed the territory around the city of Certa, and have begun to spread.
<em>Certa</em> is the name of both the movement and its stronghold in Royal; in Common, they are often called King-Slayers or Gold-Bloods (the latter being an epithet).</p>
<p>The city of Certa was built on the site of a much older city, which was destroyed almost a century ago.
The remains of that city where claimed by the nascent Certan movement, and its reconstruction began 62 years ago.
Sitting at the center of the Kingdoms of Men, Certa is a crossroads; it has become a center of overland trade and travel in the Kingdoms, and has risen rapidly in wealth and prestige—though it does suffer somewhat from being several hundred <em>demarc</em> from the coast of the Glass Sea.</p>
<p>Besides the city of Certa itself, they also control the surrounding territory—and they are expanding.
So far, they have advanced to the south (toward the coast) and west (into the territory of the Western Kings), displacing local nobles as they go.</p>
<p>The Certa are not a peaceful movement; not all of the nobles that they have displaced have survived.
Though there has not yet been an open insurrection, in recent years, a number of nobles have died (or disappeared) under mysterious circumstances—and others have obviously been assassinated.
Though the Certanis have not yet been proven responsible, they have also not been particularly subtle—particularly considering that much of their expansion has been by expanding into the territories of dead or disappeared nobles near their territory.</p>
<aside class="floating hook">
<h4 id="PlotHookCerta"><a class="header-link" href="#PlotHookCerta">Plot Hook: Certa</a></h4>
<p>The Certanis are a destabilizing influence in the already-tumultuous politics of the Kingdoms of Men, which can make them a rich source of plot hooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Certanis may began an open insurrection; this might provide the Goblin Kingdoms with an opportunity for attack, pull the Commonwealth into a war to defend their Western allies, or—if the Certanis and the West wound each other too badly—place the Eastern Kings in command of the Empire.</li>
<li>A noble in the West could die under mysterious circumstances, which various factions in the Commonwealth may wish to investigate.</li>
<li>The Certans are a recent movement; the party may simply be dispatched to investigate them—to decide if they're a potential ally or a potential threat.</li>
<li>The Certans might not be as guilty as everyone assumes.  Maybe many of the assassinations in the West are actually the result of treachery by Eastern Kings, and they are simply framing the Certans.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>Though the Certanis are anti-monarchist, they are not particularly egalitarian; wealthy merchants and land-holders have largely stepped into the place of displaced nobles.
Though Certa is nominally a Republic, only those with &quot;a vested interest in the prosperity of the people&quot;—that is, the wealthy, people of business, and land-owners—can actually vote in elections for the <em>Chamber of Law</em>, or hold seats in it.
(The <em>Chamber of Law</em> is the only house in the Republic that can actually make law; the <em>Chamber of the People</em> serves a purely advisory role.)</p>
<p>The Certanis consider themselves natural allies to the Commonwealth—their movement was inspired by their powerful, peaceful and mercantile neighbor.
Unfortunately, the Kings of the West have been the main victims of the wave of political assassinations that is largely credited to the Certanis; given that the Kings of the West are allies of the Commonwealth, this makes any potential alliance between the Certanis and the Commonwealth somewhat fraught.
What is perhaps worse is that some believe that the Certanis may not contain their regicide to the Kingdoms of Men; the Dragonshire also has a hereditary nobility—even if they have largely surrendered power to representative governments.</p>
<aside class="floating hook">
<h4 id="PlotHookCertasSecretLoyalties"><a class="header-link" href="#PlotHookCertasSecretLoyalties">Plot Hook: Certa's Secret Loyalties</a></h4>
<p>Why <em>have</em> the Kings of the West been the Certani's main victims?
Certainly one possibility is that they're weaker.
Though the Kings of the West are often wealthier than those of the East, they are also often less militaristic and more mercantile—thus they're more vulnerable to insurrection.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the Certanis are a cat's-paw; if so, who's agenda are they really serving?</p>
<p>It might be the Kings of the East; they may using the Certanis to weaken and slay the Kings of the West, in a way that the Commonwealth will not rapidly intervene to stop.
It might be the Goblin Kings, for much the same reason—this may be more likely, given that the Certanis are expanding rapidly towards the coast of the Glass Sea.
Even more sinister is that the Goblins may be doing this to curry favor with the Eastern Kings.
It could also be the Leapers; they may have decided to undermine the Kingdoms with guile rather than overt subjugation.
It might even be a Tempter—or a spirit like them—seeking power for themselves.</p>

<h3 id="TheHaffa"><a class="header-link" href="#TheHaffa">The Haffa</a></h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Haffa lies in the extreme northwest of the Kingdoms of Men; it shares a border with the Commonwealth.
Its current capital is called Ehnef in Royal, although it is sometimes referred to as nal'Haffa (literally &quot;Haffa Capital&quot;); it's called Grey-Blood's Weir in Common, named for a spill-over dam on a river immediately to the east that feeds the water-channels that supply the city with water.</p>
<p>The Haffa are remarkable because they are one of the only large populations of half-breeds in the known world.
Elves and Humans are almost unique in that they can (sometimes) produce offspring; these offspring frequently benefit from a kind of hybrid vigor—they are often taller, heavier and stronger than either elves or humans—but they can also suffer from strange, sometimes terrible diseases—ranging from the relatively benign, like bleeding easily or having strange allergies, to the debilitating and deadly, such as irregular growths, tumors or major birth defects.
They are also almost always sterile.</p>
<p>The Haffa are one of only two stable, healthy and fertile populations of Elf-Human hybrids (the other being the Shifters).
The Haffa maintain their health through selective breeding, special medicines, and magical intervention—the exact nature of which is not widely known outside of the Haffa royal line.
(Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Haffan court heavily patronizes physicians, and their healers are renowned throughout much of the world—they are certainly among the best in the Kingdoms.)</p>
<aside class="floating hook">
<h4 id="PlotHookTheSecretsoftheHaffa"><a class="header-link" href="#PlotHookTheSecretsoftheHaffa">Plot Hook: The Secrets of the Haffa</a></h4>
<p>The (secret) magical intervention that the Haffa use to ensure their health is an obvious plot hook.
What is it?
Was it a deal struck with a powerful spirit centuries ago, like the one that created the Drakes?
What spirit was it struck with, and what cost was demanded?
Or is it on-going, some magical process that requires constant tending—and which could spell the downfall of the Haffa if it is ever disrupted, which their enemies may seek to do.</p>
</aside>
<p>The Haffans politics are determined for them by their blood and their location; they have long been allies of the Kingdom of Ahnaff and the Commonwealth, with whom they share borders, and they are also major supporters of the current High King, Kass Ahnaff, who has been their shelter against the predations of the Eastern Kings.
Conversely, they are despised by the Eastern Kings, who loathe them for their non-human blood; while open conflict between Kingdoms has been rare since the Third High Kingship in CY 695, the Eastern Kings have missed no opportunity to wound the Haffa.</p>
<p>Most recently, between CY 789 and CY 797, the Eastern Kingdoms deployed all their wealth and power to target Lords on the eastern border of the Haffa; after their finances crumbled, the Easterners purchased the Haffans' lands and holdings.
What followed was a time of brutal abuse, as the peasantry that lived in those holds where starved and brutally abused by their new, distant Eastern Lords
As their circumstances became dire, the Haffan peasantry began to revolt; between CY 811 and 814, the Eastern Kings attempted to muster an army to suppress the revolts, but Ayl Ahnaff, Kass Ahnaff's granfather and the High King at the time, refused to raise the Kingdom's army or allow the Easterners to quarter in his territory.
This made it impossible for the Eastern Lords to maintain control, and resulted in their selling their holdings to both the Haffan king and Ayl—the latter out of spite, to keep the Haffan's land out of their hands for as long as possible.
The incident secured the Haffa's loyalty to the Ahnaff line for generations—as well as their deep hatred of the Eastern Kings.</p>

<h3 id="History"><a class="header-link" href="#History">History</a></h3>
<h4 id="TheRaptorEmpire"><a class="header-link" href="#TheRaptorEmpire">The Raptor Empire</a></h4>
<p>The Raptors have long been the dominant race throughout the mountainous jungles of the central Ruby Plane, divided into diverse tribes and cultures.
Around CY 40, the <em>Terrace-Builder</em> Raptors built their first large cities in the northeast corner of the mountains.
They developed a style of terrace-building, and used it extensively both for urban design and agriculture.</p>
<p>The early settlements developed into city-states.
They were broken into <em>castes</em>: roughly, <em>rulers</em>, <em>administrators</em>, <em>soldiers</em>, and <em>farmers</em>.
Rather than using money, they used a <em>corvee</em> system: individuals where required to contribute labor to the city-state's projects—which included farming (which was done collectively), the construction of roads, terraces and buildings, and serving as a soldier.</p>
<p>An alliance of two Raptor city-states—Giant's Stairs and River-Cutter's City—came to prominance and, over the following centuries, eventually built an empire.
Their conquests where subtle, using a mix of diplomacy and military threat; often, rather than pursue the total conquest of an enemy, they chose to end conflicts once favorable terms had been secured.
This put the Raptors in the position of managing a heterogeneous empire, whose subjects they had not entirely defeated and pacified; in order to control this empire, they had to manage a careful mix of diplomatic, military and economic pressure.
They also had to play the different parts of their fracuous empire against each-other, using one faction as a counter-weight to another; they where masters at maintaining enough internal cohesion to preserve their prosperity and military strength, while keeping their clients at-odds enough to maintain control.</p>
<h4 id="TheRatfolkArrive"><a class="header-link" href="#TheRatfolkArrive">The Ratfolk Arrive</a></h4>
<p>The Ratfolk had long lived in the Warren Isles; they where a society fishers, farmers and traders.
Between CY 331, several larger Ratfolk cities united, and began the conquest of their neighbors; this started an ocean-born exodus, with some of the refugees settling on the northwest shores of the Ruby Plane; this exodus only intensified when the Shade Elves began to raid the Warren Isles in CY 346.</p>
<p>The Ratfolk that settled on the Ruby Plane where far from the center of power of the Raptor Empire—Giant's Stairs and River-Cutter's City where on the other side of a jungle-covered mountain range.
The Ratfolk brought with them a mercantile culture, and relatively sophisticated technology—unlike much of the Ruby Plane, they had mastered the use of iron, for example, and where proficient sailors.
They prospered on the Ruby Plane, and made allies—including the Brightfeathers, a parrot-like race that lived in the mountains of the northwest.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Ratfolk began to trade with several of the tribes of Raptors that lived in the southwest flanks of the mountains; those tribes where tributaries of the Raptor's Empire just as much as any other race was.
Though neither the Ratfolk nor the Brightfeathers where warlike, in the eyes of the Raptor Empire, they began to form a dangerous competitor.</p>
<h4 id="TheShadedSeaAttacks"><a class="header-link" href="#TheShadedSeaAttacks">The Shaded Sea Attacks</a></h4>
<p>Then, in CY 454, the Warren-Isles Ratfolk and the Shade Elves of the Emerald Plane, united under the Leapers, began to attack the northwest Ruby Plane—most heavily falling on the Ratfolk there.
The Ruby-Isles Ratfolk sought out the aid of the militarily powerful Raptor Empire, offering to become tributaries if the Empire would protect them.
The Raptor Empire, long used to juggling a vast empire of only weakly-bonded peoples, offered the Ratfolk favorable terms: military aid, in exchange for the Ratfolk's nominal submission, and access to their prosperous markets.</p>
<p>The Raptor Empire marched west, and helped the Ratfolk resist the Shaded Sea raiding.
In 456, the Shaded-Sea Ratfolk had established a permanent military encampment on the Ruby Plane; by 477, the Raptor Protectorate had pushed the Shaded-Sea Peoples off the Ruby Plane entirely—though their seaborn raiding would never completely cease.</p>
<h4 id="Prosperity"><a class="header-link" href="#Prosperity">Prosperity</a></h4>
<p>For centuries, the Raptor Empire prospered; the terrace-builder Raptors cut roads through the mountains and jungles, and allowed goods to flow from the Ratfolk in the west to the Raptors in the east.
The Terrace-Maker Raptor's society was dramatically altered; trade with the Ratfolk made them wealthier, and that wealth made them more mercantile.
While they still use a system of corvee labor, they pay their citizens a small wage collected from trade; they also allow their citizens to purchase their way out of corvee labor.
In turn, a <em>merchant</em> class has developed, who trade profitably with other cultures and purchase their way out of corvee obligations.</p>
<h4 id="TheGoblinEmpire"><a class="header-link" href="#TheGoblinEmpire">The Goblin Empire</a></h4>
<p>In CY 617, Goblins first established a settlement on the northeast Ruby Plane.
In CY 703, the Goblin Empire was formed, and they began their sack and conquest of the Ruby Plane in earnest.</p>
<p>As the Goblin Empire conquered their way inland from their foothold on the Ruby Plane, members of the cultures and races that the Goblins conquored sought the protection of the Raptors.
Soon, the Raptor Protectorate began to swell with the refugees of the Goblin's conquest.</p>
<h4 id="ThePresent"><a class="header-link" href="#ThePresent">The Present</a></h4>
<p>Today, the Raptor Protectorate have face enemies on two fronts.
So far, direct confrontation between the Raptor Protectorate and the Goblin Empire has been minimal; the Empire has, for the most part, avoided territories claimed or protected by the Protectorate.
On the west, though the Shaded-Sea People claim no territory on the Ruby Plane, their raiding has been a constant threat.</p>
<h3 id="Culture"><a class="header-link" href="#Culture">Culture</a></h3>
<p>The Raptor Protectorate integrates several different cultures from through the Ruby Plane—though its two dominant cultures remain the Terrace-Builder Raptors, who lead the Protectorate and provide most of its military might, and the Iron-Worker Ratfolk, who remain drivers of their trade-network and economy.</p>
<h4 id="TheTerraceBuilderRaptors"><a class="header-link" href="#TheTerraceBuilderRaptors">The Terrace-Builder Raptors</a></h4>
<p>The Terrace-Builder Raptors continue to use a distinctive system of terraces for agricultural production in the highlands of the Raptor's Peaks.
They also continue to construct and occupy some of the largest urban centers on the Ruby Plane.
Their systems of caste and corvee labor also survive—although perhaps somewhat changed.
Their leaders are still drawn from the <em>rulers</em> caste, and their administrators are still drawn from the <em>administrators</em> caste.
Members of the <em>soldiers</em> caste still form the elite troops of their armies; they are trained in war from their youths, and serve their city-states as labourers when the army is not active.
Farmers, in turn, work the terraced fields, and serve as craftsmen in rural settlements.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Iron-Worker Ratfolk in the Protectorate brought profitable trade, and with it chnage.
The &quot;tribute&quot; that the Iron-Workers pay to the Terrace-Builders is minor, but profit from trade with them is significant; the Terrace-Builters also charge a tarrif on goods carried over the extensive network of roads that they maintain through the Raptor's Peaks at the center of the Ruby Plane.
Much as the city-states collected the agricultural product of the terraced farms and distributed food among their citizens, now they collect tribute and tarrifs from trade, and distribute this among their people—minus a portion claimed by the city-states themselves.
This means, in practice, that those doing corvee labor now receive a modest wage.</p>
<p>To encourage profitable trade and useful craft, most Terrace-Builder Raptors allow members of the Soldier and Farmer castes to purchase an exemption from most corvee duties.
This directly adds to the city-state's coffers, but it has also enabled the development of a profitable professional class of merchants and artisans within the Terrace-Builder's city-states, and further brisk trade with the distant Iron-Workers Ratfolk.
This, in turn, has allowed the Terrace-Builders to import a number of the innovations that the Ratfolk brought to the Ruby Plane.</p>

</aside>
<p>Much ancient Terrace-Builder construction used fieldstones, though most most major construction in modern city-states is done using carefully dressed stone masonry—often limestone.
The use of brick construction is also common, especially for minor buildings and in villages outside of their citystates; they are often face with mudbrick.
Thatch is often used for roofing, and ornamentation is rare.</p>
<p>Raptor buildings are often designed for communal use.
Many buildings are large and open, without walls; sheets of thick fabric are used for doors and internal partitions.</p>
<p>In the mountains and foothills, the Terrace-Builders often lay their cities out in terraces; they often exploit natural defences, building walls only at the entrances to vallies.
In the plains to the extreme east of the Empire, they sometimes use a more regular, level city-plan, with walls all-around.</p>
<p>Raptors use a 6-day week, with the precise schedule varying by caste—the Farmer caste works three days in the field and two days for the city-state, and has one day off.
The sixth day begins with a short ritual meal, but is otherwise left to the citizen.</p>
<p>Terrace-Builder Raptors have spent centuries riding herd over an empire consisting of diverse peoples; they tend to be very open, and they are welcoming to members of strange new races and cultures.
Members of countless different races can be found in the prosperous markets of the Terrace-Builders' city-states.
However, it is not easy for an outsider to find a permanent place in their city-states: their caste system influences every part of their society, and it is not easy to operate within their society without a caste affiliation (and an outsider—especially a non-raptor—cannot easily claim a caste).</p>

<p>They live throughout the northwest of the Ruby Plane, in large cities and small fishing villages.</p>

<p>Goblin society is ruled by Kings and Warlords.
Kings control cities, towns and territories—the means for food, industry and trade.
Warlords, in turn, control bands of Goblin fighters.
Kings jostle amongst themselves, forming alliances and competing for power, but they also compete for the services of warlords; kings' arrangements with warlords are openly mercenary—there is little pretense of honor, loyalty or higher causes—and they can be extremely fragile.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, rule in Goblin society can be extremely unstable.</p>
<p>This does not have as great an impact on Goblin society as it could, however, because law and commerce are not administered by their Kings; instead, they have a parallel legal system, founded in the Code, and administered by Judges.</p>
<h4 id="TheCode"><a class="header-link" href="#TheCode">The Code</a></h4>
<p>Originally called the <em>North Coast Code,</em> the Code was a formalization of the customs used to govern trade between several cities on the southern coast of the Glass Sea—the sea between the Kingdoms of Men and the Goblins.
Though it was only originally intended as a trading agreement between a handful of cities, it began to spread; though it doesn't claim to be ordained great spirits, destiny or fate, it has nevertheless come to occupy a central place in Goblin society.</p>
<p>The Code has evolved over the centuries; eight major schools of legal scholarship have developed, and each has accepted modifications to the Code itself—the Code never claimed to be unmodifiable, although no procedure for amending it was specified.
In general, there is little competition between Schools; Goblins tend to view each of the schools as being equally valid, thinking of them much like the way that members of the Commonwealth think of different provinces.</p>
<p>Judges as such are few: there may be only three or four in a city of five thousand.
They have the support of clerks, scholars, and Enforcers—though the ranks of the Enforcers will be fewer than the forces of local Kings and Warlords, they are numerous enough to enforce the Judge's judgments on the populace.
Those who appear before Judges can hire Advocates—scholars of the law who specialize in pleading before Judges.
Advocates' skills are highly valuable, and they are often important, powerful and wealthy members of their communities.</p>

In early CY 378, the First king-by-the-Assembly was appointed.</p>
<p>The First King-by-the-Assembly had the loyalty of most Kings—and could exploit the internal peace to buy most Warlords—and was able to rally stronger resistance to the Kingdoms; however, they where still overmatched.

<p>The Third High Kingship of the Kingdoms of Men (CY 695), the peace between the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire (beginning in CY 698), and the incorporation of the Dragonshire into the Commonwealth at the signing of the Commonwealth Compact (CY 744) spelled the end of the Goblins as a major power on the Emerald Plane; the new Commonwealth was far too vast, wealthy and powerful for the Goblin Kings to compete with.</p>
<h4 id="TheEmpire"><a class="header-link" href="#TheEmpire">The Empire</a></h4>
<p>Goblins hailing from southern kingdoms first sailed far enough south to reach the Ruby Plane in CY 538; they found in the northeastern Ruby Plane an arid land, populated by relatively primitive people—a land the could plunder, full of people who would be their slaves.
Goblin sailing techniques rapidly improved, and by CY 617 they had established a permanent outpost on the northern shore of the Ruby Plane.</p>
<p>In CY 703, the Noble Assembly once again appointed a ruler—this time an Empress.
She was given the power to assembly an Empire—to raise taxes, to build an Imperial administration, and to levy the forces of the kings and warlords and place them under her command.
She was given this power for the express purpose of efficiently conquering and plundering the Ruby Plane.</p>
<p>The Goblin Empire has seen a rapid rise in the Goblin's fortune.
They have conquered a large swath of the northeast Ruby Plane, displacing, enslaving or exterminating many of the native races in the process.
The territory on the Ruby Plane is now larger than their territory on the Emerald Plane—though they still rule this territory from the Emerald Plane.</p>
<p>In characteristic style, modern Goblin society has at least three centers of power, all of them cooperating only slightly more than they compete: The Imperial administration rules their society, but only so long as it has the consent of the Kings—that is, only so long as it enriches the Kings with treasure plundered from the Ruby Plane.
The Kings, in turn, try to keep the Empire on a short leash, giving it no more power than it needs to coordinate the conquest of the Ruby Plane.
And through it all, the Judges remain, ruling on matters of law and custom.</p>
<h3 id="TheEconomyandSlavery"><a class="header-link" href="#TheEconomyandSlavery">The Economy—and Slavery</a></h3>
<p>Slaves have long been one of the chief resources of the Goblin economy—the North Coast Code specifically granted Goblins the right to take any non-Goblin as a slave, and very few scholars of the Code have questioned this provision or called for change.</p>
<p>Acquiring slaves on their home plane grew more and more difficult as the other peoples and nations of the eastern Emerald Plane grew stronger; it effectively became impossible with the signing of the Commonwealth Compact, as they could no longer risk the wrath of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Ruby Plane has become the chief source of slaves and plunder, and the economy of the Goblin Empire now revolves around the conquest and exploitation of the Ruby Plane and its people; this transformation has brought the Empire unprecedented wealth and prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="TheImperialMilitary"><a class="header-link" href="#TheImperialMilitary">The Imperial Military</a></h3>
<p>Goblin metal-working has long lagged behind that of the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire; owing to their long talons, awkward hands, and stiff bone-plated backs, they have never been able to ride horses well; and the forces of Kings and Warlords are often highly heterogeneous—and almost always reinforced with slaves.
All of these factors have meant that the Goblin Kings have long lagged behind the other militaries of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<p>Still, they are not without advantages.
Several Goblin Kingdoms have cultivated expertise in chemistry, alchemy and medicine, and they have used these skills to turn their slave ranks into forces to be feared.</p>
<p>They have also used their time on the Ruby Plane wisely.
Though the troops levied from Kings and Warlords may vary widely in tactics, composition and quality, the Empire has reorganized them into regular units, drilled them, and deployed them together; this has led to rapid improvements in their coordination.
The Empire has also experimented with new technologies—they are the only power besides the Commonwealth to experiment with guns and cannons.</p>
<h4 id="TheInfantry"><a class="header-link" href="#TheInfantry">The Infantry</a></h4>
<p>Goblins commonly use large formations of infantry equipped with long spears or pikes.
The first two ranks carry shields: the first rank will fight kneeling, with their spears braced at their feet and their shields readied, while the second rank fights standing and holding their shield up—though also with their spears braced.
The ranks behind them fight with their spears or pikes held overhead, attacking by thrusting.</p>
<p>These pike-wielding formations can be extraordinarily deadly, but they are also very vulnerable if they are flanked; for this reason, support is essential.
The flanks of these formations are often guarded by ranks equipped with crossbows or hand-cannons—Goblins are not well designed for the use of bows, but they can use guns and crossbows effectively.</p>
<p>Goblins do not field heavy cavalry the way the Kingdoms of Men do—although they do field deadly light cavalry.
Gremlins do not have long talons interfering with their ability to grip, they do not have bony plates impeding their flexibility, they are light enough to ride two-to-a-horse, and—vitally—they can be trusted enough to play a vital role in a fighting force, unlike other slaves.
Gremlins ride two-to-a-horse, typically in light armor, carrying guns or crossbows; though they are almost incapable of mounting a charge like mounted human Knights can, they make deadly skirmishers and archers.
Because there is a separate jockey and crossbow-wielder or cannoneer, they can fire effectively while moving at speed; because they are so fast and mobile, they can close to a much shorter range without feer of being effectively engaged—even by enemy archers.
And because they are so lite and quickly, they are particularly effective at running down an enemy who breaks; this capability is very important, as it has allowed the Goblin Empire to turn many partial victories into devastating routes.
Sometimes, these light cavalry will carry man-catchers, nets, bolos and other weapons designed to debilitate and capture fleeing enemies; a future of misery and slavery awaits those so captured—and wealth and reward awaits the Gremlin who captures many future slaves.</p>
<p>When operating in smaller units, Goblins often field a single formation, of mixed pike-wielders and crossbow-wielders.
Each rank will be a mix of pikes and crossbows; in the first two ranks, the pike-wielders will also carry shields.
When the enemy is at range, the crossbow-wielders will stand next to the pike-wielders; the pikes will cover them with their shields.
As the enemy closes, the crossbows will step back into the pikes, who will close ranks in front of them; if the enemy engages the formation in melee, the crossbows will fight with their talons.
This requires careful coordination; if order collapses, the results are likely to be catastrophic.
The Goblin Empire drills these formation often, and is careful to arrange troop rotations so that all of their infantry have experience deploying these tactics in combat.</p>
<p>Though Goblin Kings have long made use of slave rabble in their military tactics, the Goblin Empire is less willing to do so; the loyalty and reliability of slaves recently acquired from the cultures of the Ruby Plane remain a serious concern.
Still, some generals do press slaves into service—especially members of larger and more battle-capable races; these slaves are often paid a wage and afforded better treatment, the better to secure their loyalty.</p>
<h4 id="CannonsHobgremlinsandOtherExperiments"><a class="header-link" href="#CannonsHobgremlinsandOtherExperiments">Cannons, Hobgremlins and Other Experiments</a></h4>
<p>For centuries, with few exceptions, Goblins have lagged behind both the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms of Men in military technology.
In an effort to close this gap, the Empire has been using the Ruby Plane as a kind of military laboratory, testing out new technologies and tactics against inferior enemies.</p>
<p>One such technology is the use of gunpowder weapons.
The Goblin Empire is one of two major powers in the known world to experiment with guns and cannons—the other one being the Commonwealth.
The Goblin Empire had hoped that these weapons would provide a powerful edge in their conquest of the Ruby Plane; while they have been a powerful advantage, they have not provided the edge that the Goblins hoped.
Guns are powerful, but they are, in many ways, unnecessary: none of the races or cultures that they have conquered have made heavy use of heavy metal armours, so guns provide no great advantage over conventional bows and crossbows.
Similarly, though cannons <em>have</em> proved to be devastating seige weapons, the designs available to the Goblin Empire are not portable or wieldy enough to be effectively deployed against infantry; this limits the advantage that they provide in open warfare.
Cannons are also expensive, and impose a significant baggage train.</p>
<p>Hobgremlins are a more gruesome example.
Hobgremlins represent an attempt to close the gap in physical power between Goblins and other, larger races, without relying on (untrusted) slaves in battle.
Hobgremlins are alchemical creations, created by the magical, surgical and alchemical manipulation of Gremlins; the procedure is gruesome, and the results are horrifying.</p>
<p>Hobgremlins are indeed much more physically imposing than Gremlins or Goblins; they are often as large as Gnolls, and stronger and tougher.
They often also possess other advantages, like potent natural weapons, venoms, thick hides or acute senses.
Horrifyingly, they are mentally <em>reduced</em> as much as they are physically enhanced; the experiment is only useful if it produces warriors that the Goblins can trust and control more than a typical slave, and so Hobgremlins are mentally crippled, and conditioned to be loyal to their Gremlin tenders and Goblin masters.
This crippling can sometimes involve physically lancing parts of the brain, a procedure that leaves the Hobgremlin an invalid—if they survive at all.
The alchemical processes that create Hobgremlins can also be unstable; they may suffer deformity and illness—deadly allergies and strange addictions are common.</p>
<p>Though the process has not been completely abandoned, it was never widespread, and its use has declined.
One reason is that the results where unreliable; it can be frustratingly difficult to keep Hobgremlins healthy, and the damage to their minds limits their use on the battlefield.
Even more dangerous—though the Empire may never admit it—was the impact that it had on Gremlins int he Empire.
Gremlins where horrified by the process, and deeply resented the degradation being visited upon themselves and their kin—so much so that at least one Gremlin doctor involved in the experiments defected to the Ruby Alliance.
The Empire feared that, if the experiments continued, they might face a Gremlin uprising—a terrifying prospect, as the Empire is dependant on Gremlin slave-handlers to function.</p>
<p>Now, Hobgremlins are rarities, produced only by the most secure or most foolish Goblins.
Even more rare are similar experiments on other races; these rarely end well for the Goblins involved because, while the specimens created are powerful, they are also much less &quot;sympathetic&quot; to their Goblin masters than Trusted Gremlin slaves.</p>
<h4 id="TheNavy"><a class="header-link" href="#TheNavy">The Navy</a></h4>
<p>The Goblin navy is vital for connecting their territories on the Ruby Plane with their homeland.
This navy is primarily a defensive and logistical force—protecting their landings, ferrying troops and equipment from the mainland and riches back home.</p>
<h3 id="OtherNations"><a class="header-link" href="#OtherNations">Other Nations</a></h3>
<p>While the Goblin Empire has made no peace overture to the Kingdoms of Men or the Commonwealth as such, they have avoided any conflict with those powers.</p>
<p>The Goblin Empire is, of course, an enemy of the Raptors' Protectorate, and the two are at war; indeed, the very mission of the Protectorate is to provide a safe refuge from the predations of the Shaded Sea Peoples and the Goblin Empire.
So far, however, direct conflict has been minimal: the Protectorate lags behind the Empire in technological sophistication and military capability, and so they have focused on securing their borders and integrating and arming their refugee populations.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has been slow to form an alliance with the Raptors' Protectorate—they are slow to start a war that may consume half a continent on another's behalf—but sympathy for the Protectorate has long been strong in the Commonwealth, and relations between the two have been strengthening.
The Goblins know that such an alliance is coming, and that they may lack the diplomatic means to stop it; in recent years, they have begun to prepare to fight a war on two fronts.</p>
<p>Even though the Commonwealth has not yet formally allied with the Protectorate, they have long meddled in the affairs of the Goblin Empire—through spies directly commissioned by the council, and through the tacit support of organizations like the High Road.</p>
<p>While some kings have sought allies among the kings and nobles of the Eastern Kingdoms, such overtures have not yet been fruitful, and the Empire has not yet given them its official support; the southern Human Kingdoms have long been enemies of the Goblin Kings, and the Kings of the East are slow to forgive.</p>
<p>The Goblins have little contact with the Shaded Sea Peoples, as a continent separates the two (and because the Commonwealth patrols the sea south of their borders, cutting off an ocean route).</p>

<p>Deep-Explorer Dwarves are an offshoot of the shallow-digging Dwarven culture of the North; highly individualistic, they fled their kin when the Mindsharing movement began.
&quot;Deep-Explorer&quot; is their formal name in Commonwealth Standard; they are also sometimes called Caver Dwarves or Ground-Explorers, and their name for themselves is <em>Drahrat</em>—a swipe at the Mindsharing Dwarves, or <em>Fahrat</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Root-of-the-Shade-Tree&quot; is the (awkward) formal name in Commonwealth Standard of a small Dwarven outpost near Triumph; it is often shortened to Shade-Root.
The entrance to the outpost is at the end of a small natural cave that branches off of the Carved Road.</p>
<p>The outpost is a maze; though (some) of the walls have been bricked-over and (some) of the floors have wooden platforms and walkways, the outpost is still built within the confines of a twisting, turning natural cavern.
Their front gate turns back on itself before leading to a main cavern 90 <em>strides</em> [75m] across; small shops and residences surround the walls: some may be free-standing structures, though others are merely facades over cave entrances.</p>
<p>As is usual for a <em>Drahrat</em> settlement, visitors are not allowed outside of the &quot;main&quot; cavern; the full extents of Shade-Root are unknown.
It is unknown how the outpost acquires (or produces) food, how they get out of the cavern (they make little use of the Carved Road), where their stores are kept, or even how many <em>Drahrat</em> actually live there.</p>

<h3 id="History"><a class="header-link" href="#History">History</a></h3>
<p>Early in CY 509, a psychically-reactive fungus was discovered underneath an island in the Haven Isles; experiments with this organism eventually spawned the Mindsharing Dwarves, or the <em>Fahrat</em>.
This new Dwarven sub-culture was greeted with extreme skepticism by some; among the most extreme were the movement that would become the Deep-Explorer Dwarves—or <em>Drahrat</em>—who vanished into the depths to flee their Mindsharing cousins.</p>
<p>The Deep-Explorer Dwarves originated in the <em>Lun</em>, a federation of several Dwarven holds dug into the low peaks at the northern end of the Worldspine Mountains.
They where (and still are) relatively insular, and where not among the Dwarven clans that joined the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Descendants of another confederation 9 <em>demarc</em> [38km] to the East had left more than a century prior to settle in the Haven Isles, and it was there that psions and philosophers studying the <em>Fahra</em>, the mindsharing fungus, settled.
As the properties of the Fahra where explored, and as a movement began to develop around it, the insular and individualistic <em>Lun</em> began to fear what the <em>Fahrat</em> might become, and began to seek escape.
Their fear was great enough that they sought a shelter that the <em>Fahrat</em> could never breach, even if they should consume the entire surface: they dug into the depths.</p>
<p>The <em>Drahrat</em> began to explore the depths in CY 517.
More of their civilization moved underground over the following decades: by CY 533, their culture had mostly moved underground.
Their surface settlements, now highly fortified, where little more than trading posts and support hubs.</p>
<p>Little more is known about the history of the enigmatic <em>Drahrat</em>.</p>
<h3 id="TheDrahratToday"><a class="header-link" href="#TheDrahratToday">The Drahrat Today</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Drahrat</em> reveal little of themselves, and little is known about them.
It is unknown where or how the <em>Drahrat</em> produce or acquire food; how they travel form settlement to settlement; where their stores are; how they acquire or produce the goods they trade; or even how many of them there are or where their populations reside.</p>
<p>The Drahrat have breached the surface at several other far-flung points; like their former homeland, these constructions are heavily fortified and lightly populated, serving as little more than trade-posts for surface dwellers.
The Drahrat have also constructed outposts near the settlements of other subterranean races, notably near several Clay Men holds and Kobold cities; trade with these outposts provide other races' only insight into the Drahrat society.
All known Drahrat settlements are built in natural caverns, with little artificial excavation.
They also make heavy use of natural materials—and, conversely, little use of worked materials.
Drahrat settlements are constructed out of wood, plant matter, hide, bone and scale—and with little use of metal, glass or carved stone.
One notable partial exception is a type of brick that they make by preparing and baking a fungus-root; it is believed that this is intended as a deliberate insult to the <em>Fahrat</em>.</p>
<p>Though the <em>Drahrat</em> are willing enough to trade with other races, outsiders are not allowed outside of their market-squares.
They often offer exotic natural materials for trade, like those they use in their own construction: strange foods, unusual medicines, and the bones, hides and scales of unusual creatures.
They also offer goods acquired from far-flung cultures, although how they move goods from the Ruby Plane to the Emerald Plane (for example) is unknown.
The <em>Drahrat</em> have also mapped extensive networks of caves, and sometimes offer the use of these caves in trade.</p>
<p>They appear to have some mechanism that allows them to pass under the Worldspine mountains, and to reach the Haven Isles and Ruby Plane as well; whether they have dug their own underways (like those constructed by Kobolds) or have built something like the Commonwealth's Kairne Network—or perhaps a mix of both—is unknown.
It is suspected that they have a larger population that they have revealed, that they have access to water and some kind of farming, and that they have larger cities that they have not revealed—although whether this is true and what form any of them may take is unknown.</p>

<li>Less dramatically, if the Leapers take a <em>Drahrat</em> settlement, then they might have access to the <em>Drahrat</em>'s unknown transit-path; the <em>Drahrat</em> may turn to the Commonwealth for aid in fighting off this common enemy.</li>
<li>A hook that goes back before role-playing games existed, the <em>Drahrat</em> may find something deep underground—something dangerous, something they can't control.  This might be as simple as a giant flaming monster, as insidious as a mysterious organism taking them over (ironically enough), or as strange as an ancient carved totem of inscrutible power and origin (or some other out-of-context problem).</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>The full extent of their military resources are unknown, but their defences appear impressive.
In CY 795, a Shaded Sea raiding party broke into the Carved Road and attacked the settlement of Shade-Root (see above); this allowed several Commonwealth traders caught in the settlement's market a rare glimpse into the <em>Drahrat</em>'s formidable defences.
Like almost all <em>Drahrat</em> settlements, Shade-Root is built into natural caves, with very little artificial excavation; because of this, every passageway is narrow and twisting, lines of site are limited, and there are countless natural choke-points.
When the attack occurred, the <em>Drahrat</em> ruthlessly exploited these natural defences by blocking off these narrow passages and blind curves with massive shields mounted on wheeled carriages; they then fired repeating crossbows from behind these fortifications.
Invaders struck by these bolts fell rapidly even when their wounds where minor, which lead some of the witnesses to suspect that the <em>Drahrat</em> where using poison.</p>

<h3 id="History"><a class="header-link" href="#History">History</a></h3>
<p>Nearly four centuries ago, between CY 534 and CY 561, the islands where settled by both Commonwealth and Goblinoid explorers; at the time, reaching these islands was difficult, and the colonies had little support from their parent cultures.
Conflict could be fierce, but it was also limited; neither side had substantial military resources, and the Goblins where outnumbered.
In fall of CY 559, the Goblin politics shifted violently against the King of Bronze, who collected what remained of his holdings (and the handful of fighters he could convince to defect from their various Warlords), and departed the Emerald Plane entirely; he arrived in the Horizon Islands scarcely ahead of winter.
Over the course of winter, he quickly assumed control of the Goblinoid settlements in the Horizon Islands; when Spring came, he launched a campaign against the Commonwealth settlements.
Through a series of sieges and campaigns, he was able to subdue all of the Commonwealth settlements by CY 568—some he took out-right, though others he forced into tribute.</p>
<p>The King of Bronze did not loot or despoil those cities.
He could not count on the mainland for supplies, and he did not have complete control of many of those cities—and, perhaps wisely, he knew that the Commonwealth cities had more vibrant economies than the Goblin ones, and he wished to keep those economies intact.
Instead, he allowed those cities to continue much as they always had—notably, exempting them from slavery under the code—so long as they accepted his rule, and payed his tribute.</p>
<p>This arrangement has evolved over the centuries.
The Standard-speaking and Goblin-speaking societies have cross-pollinated extensively; notably, the Commonwealth-descended population proved to have notably better education and administration systems, and so the Bronze Kings came to rely almost exclusively on Standard-speaking administrators and scribes—with the notable exception of the Code, which is still solely the province of Goblins.</p>
<p>The Standard-speaking, Commonwealth-descended communities grew more rapidly than their Goblinoid counterparts; over the next 20 to 30 years, they became the major source of local production, wealth and food for the Bronze Kings.
The Goblinoid communities, in turn, became more divided: some Goblins adopted some of their Standard-speaking neighbors' customs and values, and began to prosper with them; other, more conservative Goblins saw their power erode.</p>
<p>As ocean-going technology became more sophisticated, trade with the Emerald Plane increased—with both the Commonwealth and the Goblin Kings.
The Islands' Goblin King and Code-mediated trade system made trade with the Goblin Kings on the Emerald Plane more favorable, and provided a mechanism for conservative Goblins to retain wealth and power.</p>
<p>As the Goblin Empire's pillaging of the Ruby Plane has accelerated, one might expect the Goblin Kingdom of the Foam and Cloud to become an important and prosperous cross-roads of the Empire—but that has not happened.</p>
<h3 id="SlaveryundertheTurquoiseKings"><a class="header-link" href="#SlaveryundertheTurquoiseKings">Slavery under the Turquoise Kings</a></h3>
<p>Part of the arrangement between the King of Bronze and the Commonwealth communities who surrendered to him was that their citizens would not be taken as slaves; the King of Bronze honored this agreement, and, under his descendants' rule, the fate of slavery in the Horizon Islands has waned.
As some Goblin communities where influenced by Commonwealth customs—and as the Commonwealth-descended communities have grown wealthy and productive, and have become vital to the fortunes of the Kings of Bronze—opposition to slavery has grown stronger and stronger, and the institutions of slavery have eroded.</p>
<p>In CY 577, the King of Bronze formally restricted the taking of slaves from any of the islands' Commonwealth communities; in CY 586, he passed laws restricting the abuse of slaves; through CY 591 to CY 617, his daughter passed further reforms governing the treatment of slaves; and in CY 651, the Bronze King's great-grandson restricted slavery on the island only to those whose parents where already slaves, or who came from the Goblinoid Kingdoms with their owners—a condition that applied to fewer than a 800 people on the island.</p>
<p>Under these rules, the only remaining slaves on the islands are those who come from the Goblinoid Kingdoms on ships, and a small population of Halflings living in a traditionalist enclave on the Island of Cloud—the southernmost of the two large islands in the chain; they are effectively forced into servitude because they are the only Halflings in the island—they must either mary into slavery or die out.
They live deep within large, defended Goblin manors, jealously guarded against the outside; so isolated, they serve an almost symbolic role.</p>
<p>They are guarded so jealously because the High Road operates almost freely on the islands; they enjoy wide support among both the Commonwealth-descended and Goblin communities, and the tacit approval of the current King of Bronze.</p>
