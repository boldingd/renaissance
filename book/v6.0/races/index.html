        <h1>Races</h1>

        <p>There are three separate keywords that have special significance in Race
entries. All races will have one of the following keywords: Natural,
Supernatural or Spirit. This tells you whether the race is
flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality
(Supernatural), or is composed entirely of magical energy (Spirit).</p>
<p>Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds. You
don’t acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of
options at character creation, and you may <em>optionally</em> select them
using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or
Backgrounds during character creation. (So, for example, Shifters don't
<em>just have</em> the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during
character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible
for.)</p>
<p>Game Design Note: narrowing the stuff you get in Races down to <em>only</em>
what every member of that species would have, regardless of background.
Moving other features (c.f. skill bonuses) to backgrounds. Adding
Optional Backgrounds to races that have unique sub-cultures (like Ash
Elves, Herders or Dwarves).</p>
<p>Game Design Note: races selection should be interesting, and should
affect how you play the character. However, you shouldn’t have to pick a
specific race to get a specific feature or be good at a specific job.
This is why many abilities were moved to Backgrounds, and why many
abilities are being replaced by Traits-for-free (so that any other Race
can just take the Trait if they want to).</p>
<h2 id="CommonRaces"><a class="header-link" href="#CommonRaces">Common Races</a></h2>
<h3 id="Drakes"><a class="header-link" href="#Drakes">Drakes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though it was long known that the Drakes where a created people, it
was only a few hundred years ago, as power devolved to the people in
the Dragonshire and as their alliance with the Commonwealth drew
closer, that their true origin was revealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than a century before the Old Charter, after Karrach claimed a
swath of the Empire of Man, it had become apparent to him that he
could not govern such a large territory on his own.</p>
<ul>
<li>He had called other dragons to him, to share the rule of his
kingdom as his lords and vassals, but dragons, though long-lived
and mighty, where also few, and had little shared culture or
history before his kingdom. Karrach need a <em>people</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karrach, aided by the dragons who answered his call, began a search
for a powerful spirit willing to provide him a great boon—for a
great price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, a spirit contacted him; it variably identified itself as <em>the Bulrush God</em>, <em>the Rainstorm Shepherd</em> and <em>the Osprey’s Father</em>, and it dwelt within the southern reaches of the Dragonshire.</li>
<li>The spirit’s actual basin remains unknown, as does the extent of
its powers; they are certainly great, given what it did.</li>
<li>It gave Karrach and his followers instructions for creating holy
sites—only the precious first few of which it has actually
blessed—and a ritual they could perform there. The ritual would
convert a dragon’s egg into a drake’s egg—drakes being creatures
of dragon’s blood and kind, but smaller, less mighty and far
more fertile.</li>
<li>The price the Bulrush God demanded was perhaps surprisingly
cheap for what it did: it demanded ownership of a stretch of
lowland marsh on the southern coast of the Dragonshire, fully 20
kilometers along the coast and extending 7 kilometers inland,
and a lordly title.</li>
<li>This represented an enormous risk for Karrach, as he knew of no
way to bind the spirit, which was unknown to him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bulrush God is still worshiped in the Dragonshire.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bulrush God is enigmatic; very little is known about it,
neither its actual basin nor the true extent of its powers nor
its ultimate goals.</li>
<li>The Bulrush God answers very few supplicants; it is not known
what draws it. No bind for it is known—unsurprisingly, for a
spirit of its power.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Bulrush God interferes little in the affairs of
mortals and lesser spirits. Particularly, it has never used its
lordly title, and it has not allowed settlement of the land it
claims, and so has no subjects. (Neither has it forbidden the
land to hunters or travelers, leading many to wonder what its
actual intent with it was.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes frequently trace their lineages back to their Dragon
forebears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each egg needed to be live; thus, all Drakes have at least two
dragon ancestors, one male and one female.</li>
<li>The ritual to transform an egg required a price of each
participant dragon; it was not undertaken lightly.</li>
<li>Though Drakes can nominally be broken into clans based on their
lineage, their familiy trees where often rendered <em>complex</em> by
feudal politics; for some, their clan and heritage are important
parts of who they are; other drakes care little—or may not even
know their ancestry at all.</li>
<li>Many Drake clans (or smaller noble families) claim noble titles
and land-holdings—at least in principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
to take positions of authority, above Humans but below Dragons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
(of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of “noble blood”,
and many of them still hold hereditary titles – which may or may not
be of practical significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
neighboring state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean “blacksmithing” more
often than it means “farm work”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
proud and stubborn at worst.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
head, long tail, powerful limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
Dragons. {It may be better to say they look like Dragons, except for
being roughly humanoid in shape and size.)</p>

<h3 id="Elves"><a class="header-link" href="#Elves">Elves</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elves are a common people throughout the Emerald Plains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elves are humanoid in gross layout, although they have finer
features (including long, pointed ears).</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves have excellent hearing and vision.</li>
<li>Notably, elves are descended from arboreal creatures, and retain
prehensile feet. These are larger than human feet, owing to
being reinforced with extra tendons, bones and musculature;
thanks to this reinforcement, Elves can run on open ground as
well as humans.</li>
<li>Elves also have exotic skin pigmentations, which help them to
blend in to natural environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three major Elven ethnic groups: Wood Elves, Shade Elves
and Ash Elves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood Elves are a tribal culture, dispersed throughout the
northwestern portion of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood Elves do not have a large, overarching nation; their tribes
are usually more similar to nearby tribes of other races than to
distant Wood Elves.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth’s interactions with wood elves have, for the
most part, been peaceful; by the present day, the majority of
the wood elf tribes have signed the Commonwealth Charter (and
now the Commonwealth Compact).</li>
<li>However, most wood elf communities continue to practice
traditional, tribal ways of life; they live within the vast
interior swaths of the Emerald Plane, having little contact with
outsiders, even though they are technically Commonwealth
citizens.</li>
<li>Because of this, wood elves are rarely seen outside of their
tribal communities.</li>
<li>Wood Elves typically live in small settlements, with a few
planted fields around them. The able-bodied typically herd or
hunt, while the very young, the very old and the infirm live in
their settlements.</li>
<li>Wood Elves have a complex skin pattern, a little like an ocelot.
Their bellies, underarms and inner thighs are a dull white,
while their backs, arms and legs are a dark green. Running
through this is a complex pattern of black spots and folding and
curving lines. Their hair is often dark green or black; rarely,
it is gold or orange.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shade Elves are plains raiders hailing from the open plains on the
southwest of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the arrival of the Commonwealth, they preyed on the
peoples and cultures near them, forcing some to pay tribute and
raiding the others without mercy.</li>
<li>As the Commonwealth spread West and entered the Shade Elves’
territory, some of the tribes they had preyed upon allied with
those Commonwealth settlers.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth built a string of walled cities and fortified
keeps on the path to the sea; after a disastrous siege led to a
losing war, the Shade Elves’ territory was severely restricted.</li>
<li>This left the Shade Elves vulnerable to the Leapers, a
subterranean race that overwhelmed their largest settlements and
forced the Shade Elves to pay them tribute.</li>
<li>The Leapers later forced the Shade Elves to cooperate with their
other tributaries, the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles; the
resulting union came to be called the Shaded Sea Peoples, named
for the sea that separated the Warren Isles from the Shade
Elves’ territory on the southwest of the continent.</li>
<li>Shade Elves are still raiders, striking at settlements on the
edge of the Commonwealth and on the northwest of the Raptor’s
Plane.</li>
<li>They also participate in piracy, carried by Ratfolk ships and
sailors.</li>
<li>As members of the Shaded Sea Peoples, they are one of the
Emerald Plane’s great powers, and an enemy of the Commonwealth.
They have been in conflict with the Commonwealth off-and-on for
centuries.</li>
<li>Shade Elves live in small settlements dug into the bases of
hills and the sides of mesas and river-valleys. Their
settlements are usually fortified and walled, both to help
fending of rebellions by their tributaries and predation at the
hands of other Shade Elf clans.</li>
<li>Shade Elven skin is striped, a little like a tiger or zebra. The
stripes alternate between a dark black and a dull grey. Shade
Elven hair is similarly black and grey.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ash Elves are urban, thoughtful and philosophical people; they are
the descendants of Shade and Ash Elves who settled in the Haven
Isles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many trace the origins of the Ash Elves to the siege of
Islandholme by the Shade Elves in CY 447 and its aftermath, as
Shade Elves taken hostage in the siege where slowly ingtegrated
into the Commonwealth and interbred with Wood Elves.</li>
<li>Ash Elven settlements have also absorbed many refugees from the
tumult and cruelty of Shade Elven culture, and have served as a
familiar home for Wood Elves wishing to join a more urban
culture.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture was formed in the cities of the Haven Isles,
influenced by the countless other traditions brought there by
settlers from the rest of the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elves are a very thoughtful people, and they are avid
consumers of literature, art, law, philosophy, and other forms
of scholarship. They also tend to be highly eclectic in the
scholarship they consume, drawing for the intellectual
traditions of races and cultures throughout the commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is disciplined, mindful and meditative; they
are often reserved, stoic in the face of danger, but vibrant and
joyous in time of celebration.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to prefer urban environs, and can be found
throughout the Commonwealth’s large cities.</li>
<li>Ash Elves have also built cities of their own; they tend to
build large underground settlements, somewhat like those
constructed by Dwarves and Kobolds.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is open, egalitarian and libertine; guests are
welcome and well-treated, and they tend to get along well with
their neighbors—especially dwarves and kobolds.</li>
<li>They are particularly known for the joyous celebrations that
mark their holidays, in which their cities are brightly
decorated and travelers and neighbors are welcome.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to be strong advocates for the Commonwealth’s
continued peaceful expansion.</li>
<li>Ash Elven skin is mostly the color of ash, as the name implies;
they have a few stripes along their backs, the tops of their
arms, and the outside of their legs. The stripes are thing, and
alternate between white and black. Their hair is often black,
ash grey, pale white or ember orange.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost as social as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength
(and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls are very common in small farming communities everywhere, and
in the mid-sized manors throughout Heartland Province.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls make up more than half of the Commonwealth Military, where
their strength is invaluable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A small number of Gnollish tribal communities still exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than some other races do; because
of this, Gnollish females have long served in military and
leadership rolls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls “cultural memory” still very much includes the legend of
fleeing persecution from other savage Gnolls and settling beside
humans; to this day, Gnolls are immensely proud of their roll in
founding the Commonwealth, and the roll they continue to play in its
prosperity and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of
other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races
feel comfortable around them. Many Gnollish communities have two
separate set of customs, one for “when other races are around,” and
one for when they're not. They are not secretive about this; they do
this because, for example, they are evolved from carrion-eaters and
most other races don't want to see Gnoll “cooking.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls are aware of how savage they look, and many put quite a lot
of effort into developing elaborate, refined personal styles to
counter this effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gnolls are roughly humanoid, save their great size—and that they
have the head and feat of a hyena, and are covered in dusky or ochre
fur.</p>

<h3 id="Kobolds"><a class="header-link" href="#Kobolds">Kobolds</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kobolds are a relatively new addition to the Commonwealth; most
Kobold communities trace their origins to a mass exodus from the
Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture is very family-oriented, and very community-oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
families will cluster together to form a block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
families; because of this, they have grown explosively</p>
<ul>
<li>even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
metropolises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away – an
arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
tend to be highly productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look like tiny, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
warm-blooded.</li>
<li>Kobolds aren’t mammals; they don’t have mammary glands, and they
have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
different ideas about what constitutes “appropriate attire”.</li>

<ul>
<li>Chemical: Your claws and bite are toxic. Any creature you
hit with either attack is <em>covered</em>, and thereafter takes 2
DV a turn. Water can wash the corrosive off (requiring a
source of water and a Standard Action).</li>
<li>Cold: your natural attack gains -2 AP, and you can drain
heat from anything you hold, bite into or breath on.</li>
<li>Disease: your claws, bite and saliva carry the following
disease: Build disease rules and come back.</li>
<li>Electricity: your claws and bite deliver powerful shocks:
anyone you strike or bite must make a DUR+WIL check or be
stunned for 5 turns.</li>

<h3 id="Shifters"><a class="header-link" href="#Shifters">Shifters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
rare elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
other races.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
always have, and be left alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
they settle in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
species.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
among the communities that they settle in; “their own inclination”
is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate
to their hybrid form.</p>

<p><em>Hybrid</em>: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid. The specific
details of each form are fixed (that is, your Humanoid form (for
example) looks the same every time you shift to it; you can't
determine what your shape-shift forms look like each time you
shift). You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a
Standard Action.</p>
<ul>

<p>In Humanoid form, you have a mixture of Human and (Wood) Elvish
features.</p>

<li>
<p>In Hybrid from, you are roughly humanoid, but with the features
of an animal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you create your character, choose two of the following
benefits. You gain the chosen benefits while in Hybrid form.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.</li>
<li>Teeth: You have a predator’s jaw, which allows you to bite
foes. The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP. When you bite
someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose
to <em>latch on</em>; this normally works like grappling the
target.</li>
<li>Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on auditory
Perception checks.</li>
<li>Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in
addition to your other movement modes): Burrow 1 / 3, Climb
3 / 9, Flight 3 / 9 / 36, Glide 4 / 12 / 48, Hop 4 / 12,
Swim 3 / 9</li>
<li>Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent
sense.</li>
<li>Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you
gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this
environment. For example, you might choose to survive in
extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.</li>
<li>Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to
motion. You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving
targets.</li>
<li>Sprinter: choose one movement mode and increase it by +1/+3
(for example, Walking 4/12 would become Walking 5/15).</li>
<li>Thick Hide: You gain +1 armor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fast-Healing</em>: you have Fast Healing 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Animal Form.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you purchase this trait, you gain an Animal form as well.
Your animal form resembles a normal member of your Animal type.
Your animal form can’t be too large (as large as an elephant,
larger than size Large) or too small (as small as a cricket,
smaller than size Small).</li>

<li>
<p>Tags: Supernatural, Shape-Shifter, Amorphous, Clay Men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Groups: CM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Amorphous</em>: Clay Men are amorphous, and can manipulate their shape
at will; they can stretch, narrow, ball up, flatten out, and so on.
They cannot produce fine features, or alter their texture or color
(other than to grip, as in <em>Pseudopods</em> below), and thus they cannot
mimic specific people or objects. However, they can slip through
small spaces, and they can be almost impossible to grapple or
restrain effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Vital Organs</em>: Clay Men do not have vital organs, and thus they
are not vulnerable to attacks or powers that rely on targeting weak
points or vital organs.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have Resistance to attacks with the Precision tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Face</em>: Clay Men have no particular “front” or facing, and they
have no discrete sensory organs – so they can perceive all around
themselves, including directly above and below themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pseudopods</em>: Clay Men can extend pseudopods. They can extend up to
four pseudopods, each up to a meter long. They can manifest one
fewer pseudopod to make on other pseudopod one meter longer (so they
could, for example, extrude one four-meter pseudopod, or two
two-meter pseudopods).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Bones</em>: Lacking a skeletal structure, Clay Men cannot take
advantage of leverage; this severely reduces their ability to deploy
their strength. Their damage bonus when using melee weapons is 0.
This ability may have other consequences as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Envelop: Clay Men have a unique form of physical combat available to
them: simply enveloping (and then digesting) an enemy. Enveloping
works much like Grappling, except that a successfully enveloped
enemy takes 1d10÷2 DV per turn while enveloped (this damage has the
Chemical tag). Enveloped targets are normally held immobile, but, if
they succeed on a STR+SOM check, they can deal damage to the Clay
Man with any weapon they are holding (or any natural weapon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fast Healing</em>: Clay Men have Fast Healing 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Powered</em>: Clay Men have internal supernatural process that help to
keep them going. They need to breath (by exchanging oxygen through
their surface), but they can extract oxygen from water as well as
breathing air. They need to eat to grow, but they need little food
when not growing or repairing damage. They do not need to sleep.
They can be effected by disease, but are resistant to most diseases
that affect humanoids (they have Resistance to diseases). They do
not age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Color-Changing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can change the color of your “skin”. You can create shapes
down to the scale of a few centimeters, which allows you to
create large letters, or to camouflage yourself (providing you a
+20 to Stealth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Rigging.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can produce an internal support structure made of cartilage.
You can produce and dissolve the “rigging” at will: creating it
is a Task Action with a six hour duration, and dissolving it is
Task Action with a three hour duration. The rigging allows you
to take advantage of internal leverage, and thus negates the No
Bones trait; it also increases your STR by 5. However, the
cartilage is fragile, and it exposes you to bits of tiny broken
cartilage tumbling through you when you are injured; it reduces
your DUR by 5.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Halflings were one of the founding races of the Commonwealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halflings have a somewhat unique dimorphic society; the young and
hardy travel in Caravans, trading wares and selling their skills,
while children, the infirm and the elderly live in fixed
settlements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halfling communities tend to form close, symbiotic relationships
with Gnollish villages and families. Halfling communities are
frequently built near Gnollish towns and villages; they depend on
the Gnolls for security and labor, and the Gnolls depend on the
Halfling caravans to sell their produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, Gnolls commonly travel with Halfling caravans,
providing security—and services like smithing, for which Halflings
are poorly suited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caravans of Halfling traders and Gnollish guards knitted together
the early Commonwealth, and remain on of its most iconic elements—if
distant kindgoms know nothing else about the Commonwealth, they know
about the trade caravans, and might have been visited by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halflings have not grown at the rate that the other races have

<ul>
<li>Halfling Wagons are large horse-drawn carts that serve as both a mobile residence, work-space and shop for a Halfling businessperson (and possibly some business-partners or family).</li>
<li>The carts varied; the humblest is essentially a discarded human wagon with bunks hung from boards running along the sides as walls, while the most expensive are large, wood-sided structures whose internal spaces are divided into floors and rooms (though small even by the standards of Halflings).  Some are even designed to be opened up, becoming small shops once set up.</li>
<li>In general, a Halfling Wagon can comfortably accomodate up to four halflings, and provide work space enough to carry and use (when stopped and set-up) a Shop.</li>
<li>Halflings Wagons are neither light nor fast; the are two-axled, and are most often pulled by two horses.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Though distant from the Shade Elves, they were still within their
reach, because the Shade Elves where commonly mounted and could
strike far to the North.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Herders formed an alliance with several other nearby tribal
cultures, including a tribal Gnollish culture, for defense against
the Shade Elves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were first encountered by the Commonwealth in CY 255, and

<ul>
<li>Between 341 an 344, the Shade Elves heavily raided both
Commonwealth and Herder settlements; the two allied, and
successfully devastated the Shade Elf raiders.</li>
<li>In CY 349, the Herders signed a treaty with the Commonwealth,

<h3 id="Orcs"><a class="header-link" href="#Orcs">Orcs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Centuries ago, 165 years before the first Commonwealth Charter, orcs
founded cities in the snowy Northern reaches far to the West of the
World-Spine Mountain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The oldest Orcish lands are located on a large, flat peninsula
in the North-Western reaches of the Emerald Plane, separated
from Dwarven lands by a gulf.</li>
<li>They were a tribal society: extended Families allied into Clans,
and several Clans might cooperate to found a city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were a warlike honor-society</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcs are large and have poor reflexes; they made poor riders,
and so they marched to war on foot. Because of this, and their
fractious nature, they rarely mustered large armies and marched
to war.</li>
<li>They had ample access to sea and river; their clans built many
small, shallow-draft long-boats, and they were terrifying
raiders up and down the nearby coasts.</li>
<li>Threat of invasion, and promise of relief from raiding, were
used to force other nearby societies to pay tribute; Orcs
typically raided distant seaport cities, and the clans often
warred among themselves.</li>
<li>For conflicts within their society, they used a system of
ritualized combat.</li>
<li>The period before contact with the Commonwealth represents a
golden age for the orcs, a period of wealth and power—and a time
of misery for their neighbors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans of the Old Empire avoided Orcish lands, using their
tributaries as a buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centuries later, in CY 91, the Commonwealth began to spread west of
the World-Spine, incorporating former Imperial human settlements and
tribes (when willing) alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>In CY 113, the Commonwealth allowed a tribe of Elves who the
Orcs had claimed as tributaries to join; thereafter, the Elves
stopped paying tribute, and the orcs sacked them.</li>
<li>This led the Commonwealth to lay siege to the Orcish clan-hold
that launched the attack.</li>
<li>Other Orcish cities marshaled an army and attempted to break the
siege; their attempt failed.</li>
<li>This led to 20 years of warfare between the Commonwealth; the
Orcs were significantly outmatched by the Commonwealth military,
and most of their tributaries were liberated. By CY 131, they
were left with no tributaries, and were surrounded by
Commonwealth settlements and Commonwealth-allied tribes.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth also began to fortify the coast and
river-front; though expensive for the Commonwealth to construct,
this effectively prevented Orc raiding, as their small and
mobile raiding parties could not carry the means to break
fortifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There followed a time of misery; without the tribute they depended
on and unable to profitably raid, their society fell into decline.</p>
<ul>
<li>They were riven by internal conflict, as individuals, families
and clans battled over what wealth and power remained.</li>
<li>The Orcish population underwent a contraction, and their cities
and roads suffered great neglect and decay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generation or Orcs grew up in misery, look out at the prosperous
Commonwealth. Some went to explore it; on returning, they carried
back stories of a prosperous, diverse society.</p>
<ul>
<li>In CY 154, the orc Odna returned from exploring the
Commonwealth, and began to advocate for a radical course:
joining the Commonwealth and subscribing to their laws.</li>
<li>In CY 155, he challenged first his own clan head, and then a
champion of the clans of his city; he won both challenges, and
on behalf of his city and its clans, signed the Commonwealth
Charter; thus did the city of Akala become the first Orcish city
to join the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Access to the Commonwealth’s markets greatly eased the misery of
Akala; seeing their success, other movements in other clan-holds
also sought to join the Commonwealth..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, Orcs have been members of the Commonwealth for almost 700
years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcish culture struggled to adapt itself to Commonwealth law and
tradition: today, it is a blend of traditional Orcish elements,
imports from the rest of the Commonwealth and uniquely Orcish
innovations.</li>
<li>Their views on the Commonwealth and their place within it are
complex. Though they take pride in being members of an ascendant
and prosperous people, they also remember how they came to be
members in it—the most traditional among their numbers claim
that they were conquered, and that they still bear the shame of
it.</li>
<li>Honor continues to be highly valued in Orcish society. Though
most have taken the view that great works and labors are
achievements worthy of honor and glory, the most traditional
still believe that victory in combat is the greatest honor.</li>
<li>Though some orcs remain within their ancient borders and
practice a (modified) version of their traditions, others travel
the wider world seeking honor and accomplishment (and to bring
wealth home, since Orcish communities still do not have adequate
farming).</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, many Orcs seek honor and recognition in the
Commonwealth military. Orcs are very strong, and so many seek
work as laborers and artisans—notably, Orcish cities boast
impressive architecture. Orcs are also very clever, and some
seek honor and achievement in the Commonwealth’s universities
(Orcish scholars are generally not known for being nurturing and
understanding mentors).</li>
<li>Notably, many Elvish communities exist near Orcish ones. Most
orcs and elves have good relations, as they are both tribal
cultures and have long lived near each other—for most, their
time of conflict is centuries past and forgotten. Still, a few
of the most traditional—in both communities—continue to nurse
ancient grudges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Orcish people can claim 6 major cities: five are their
traditional cities, and the sixth was established on the
Commonwealth’s border with the Shade Elves. Of the orcs five
traditional cities, three are members of the Commonwealth, and the
remaining two are not.</p>
<ul>
<li>When dealing with each other, orcs use their ancient customs,
and orcs come and go between the Commonwealth and independent
cities freely.</li>
<li>As a historical note, the city of Tonilac changed hands once: it
was claimed by honorable combat by independent orcs, before
being reclaimed by the Commonwealth six years later.</li>
<li>The city of Collac is a Commonwealth-member that was built on
the border with the Shade Elves; it is heavily fortified, and
the orcs there skirmish constantly with the Shade Elves, their
allies, and their subjugate peoples.</li>
<li>Notably, the island city-state of Kethal is heavily settled by
Orcs; in times past, it was shared amicably by Orcs and Dwarves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orcs have a vibrant mythos and rich oral history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcs have several mythical heroes, about whom a great many
stories have been told.</li>
<li>A particularly common point in Orcish Myth, which many
historians believe corresponds to an actual event, is the Great
Plague, an event some 15 generations ago that devastated many
Orcish communities. The Great Pleague is frequently used a
setting for heroic adventures of Orcish myth.</li>
<li>Over the last few hundred years, Orcs have actively transcribed
many of these stories; their large libraries filled with
beautifully-illuminated books are points of pride for their
community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orcs are roughly humanoid. They are tall, lean and muscular. Their
skin is typically either green, brown, or red; most clans will have
one skin tone that is more common among them. Orcs also have
prominent tusks.</p>

<h3 id="Ratfolk"><a class="header-link" href="#Ratfolk">Ratfolk</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 500 years ago, there was one Ratfolk civilization in the
Warren Isles, an island chain off the Southwest near the Haven
Isles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were organized into warrens run by families, and practiced
fishing and farming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 331, 20 years before the Commonwealth started to settle Islandhome, several wealthy Ratfolk warrens united and forced their neighboring to pay tribute; they became wealthy and powerful while their kin suffored.  In the following years, other Ratfolk warlords began to rise in the Warren Isles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 361, the Shade Elves crossed the Shaded Sea and began to heavily raid the Warren Isles.</p>
<ul>
<li>large numbers of Ratfolk begin fleeing the Warren Isles.</li>
<li>Some travel north to the Haven Isles, where they were eventually incorporated into the Commonwealth;</li>
<li>others fled South to the Ruby Plane, where they encountered the Raptors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 395, the conflict between the Warren Isles Ratfolk and the Shade Elves drags to a halt; in 398, the two form a tentative alliance, creating the Shaded Sea Peoples.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is later learned that the &quot;alliance&quot; was a construct of the enigmatic Leapers.</li>
<li>The Leapers had attacked the major cities of Shade Elves and the largest warrens in the Haven Isles, and had forced both the Shade Elves and Ratfolk to pay them tribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are now 3 distinct Ratfolk cultures:</p>
<ul>
<li>they have a large population in the Commonwealth, first in the
Haven Isles and now spreading throughout Heartland;</li>
<li>they are one of the two founders of the Raptor’s Alliance,
formed with the raptors to repel Shaded Sea Peoples, including
their “cousins”;</li>
<li>the Shaded Sea Peoples, a society consisting of Ratfolk and
Shade Elf families.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural traders and merchants; in the Commonwealth, Ratfolk tend to
get along well with Halflings and Humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As scavengers, they also get along well with Gnolls; Ratfolk are one
of the few species that can eat the same food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratfolk are one of the Commonwealth’s subterranean cultures; they
often dwell in underground burrows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though Ratfolk do maintain their own culture and tradition, they
were heavily assimilated into the established Commonwealth culture
that sheltered them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are comfortable in urban environments and often live beside
other races and cultures. They are comfortable above-ground and
underground, and often work as traders and artisans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniquely Ratfolk settlements are often organized around warrens;
similar to Dwarven holds, they are mixed above-ground and
subterranean structures. They still maintain fishing and seafaring
traditions.</p>

However, even though they are Spirits, they are physical beings (and thus they have STR and DUR scores, and they may be wounded or killed using all the normal rules for creatures). More than that, it is required of them that their form always resemble that of a flesh-and-blood creature–although the details of their form are otherwise up to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Shape-Shifting</em>: Tempters can take the form of any medium-sized natural creature. They can control the details of their physical form as they wish, including being able to mimic specific individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They can change shape as a Standard Action.</li>
<li>Assuming the form of a <em>specific</em> individual requires a Disguise check at +10.</li>
<li>To competently impersonate a person whose shape they have assumed, they will still need to use the Disguise and Deception skills, but they receive a +30 and +10 bonus on these checks, respectively.</li>
<li>Normally, changing shape does not affect their statistics—but see the powers listed below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since they are spirits, people with Mage Sight can potentially see a Tempter's magical nature; however, Tempters have the ability to partially mask themselves.  Detecting a tempter with Mage Sight requires an opposed test, the Perception skill of the character with Mage Sight versus the Tempter's WIL+WIL+INT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Negative Trait: Bind</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a <em>bind</em>, the details of which you should work out with
your GM. The bind should pose a real danger to you. It must be
known to at least one clerical organization in the area where
you live – although it does not need to be widely known. (This
is a negative trait; it you select it, you <em>gain</em> 10 CP, which
you may then spend elsewhere.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Power: More than Form Alone</p>
<ul>
<li>More than simply assuming the shape of a given race, you can adopt some of their nature.</li>
<li>When you assume the form of a given race, you may choose one Aptitude in which that race has a bonus; you gain a +5 bonus to the chosen aptitude.</li>
<li>You may choose STR or DUR if that race has a higher STR or DUR than you do.</li>
<li>You must choose either INT, SAV or WIL and take a -5 penalty to that aptitude.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Power: Tempter, To Crawl and Soar</p>
<ul>
<li>You can mimic the construction of other races well enough that you gain some of their biological capabilities.</li>
<li>When you assume the form of a given race, you may choose two of the following:
<ul>
<li>One Movement Mode that race has.</li>
<li>One Sense that race has.</li>
<li>That race's armor bonus (not more than +3).</li>
<li>One natural attack that race has.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Class: Tempter, Master Shifter</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires: either the <em>More than Form Alone</em> or <em>To Crawl and Soar</em> power (or both)</li>
<li>If you have the <em>More than Form Alone</em> power, you may choose a second aptitude to gain a bonus in, using the same rules as the first.</li>
<li>(You don't have to take another -5 penalty.)</li>
<li>If you have the <em>To Crawl and Soar</em> power, you choose four times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ElfHumanHybrid"><a class="header-link" href="#ElfHumanHybrid">Elf-Human Hybrid</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elves and Humans are almost unique in that they are one of the few pairings of distinct races who can produce offspring together; however, doing so is not without complication.</p>
<ul>
<li>These half-human, half-elven children are almost always sterile; furthermore, while they are curiously immune to many inherited diseases that humans and elves are prone to, they are vulnerable to many unique defects all their own.</li>
<li>There are two notable populations of non-sterile elven-human hybrids: the Haffa, who live primarily in a their own kingdom in the Kingdoms of Men; and the Shifter tribes living to the West of the Worldspine Mountains.</li>
<li>The Haffa are the product of great fortune, magical intervention and selective breeding.</li>
<li>The origins of the Shifters are lost to history; perhaps obviously, they have been influenced by far more exotic forces than merely having a mix of elven and human blood.  (As such, Shifters are usually regarded as a separate race, and have their own entry.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“First generation” elf-human hybrids often have no culture of their own; they are often born into an elven or human culture somewhere in the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially in Westward Province, Commonwealth cities and towns often develop a shared local culture with Wood Elven tribes near them.  In these areas, hybrids are a familiar site—if not precisely common, since they usually cannot reproduce themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the few populations of non-sterile elf-human hybrids exists in the Kingdoms of Men: the Haffa.</p>

<li>
<p>Keen Senses: elf-human hybrids (usually) inherit their Elven parent’s keen senses.  They gain a +10 bonus to visual and auditory perception checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prehensile Feet: elf-human hybrids also (usually) inherit their Elven parent’s prehensile feet, although without the robust structure that makes them resistant to injury.  While hybrids gain the benefit of prehensile feet, their feet are also fragile and apt to suffer injury (this would be likely if an Athletics check is critically failed, for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endurance: Hybrid gain a measure of the remarkable endurance of humans; they gain a +10 bonus to Feat of Endurance checks.</p>

<h3 id="Goblins"><a class="header-link" href="#Goblins">Goblins</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These creatures have a thick, tan hide, and are protected on their upper back, arms and legs by bony plates.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Claws</p>
<ul>
<li>While all Goblins have large claws that allow them to tunnel,
they are usually to awkward to be used as weapons. Yours,
however, are particularly dangerous. You have claws:</li>
<li>1d10+3+DB, AP -2</li>
<li>one-handed, natural</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Gremlins"><a class="header-link" href="#Gremlins">Gremlins</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These small creatures resemble hairless cats in gross appearance, save that they have hands rather than paws, walk upright, and are not <em>much</em> larger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their homelands where conquered by Goblin kings and warlords long ago, and they have been subjects of the Goblins for centuries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though the Goblins Code does declare that all other species are inferior to Goblins and are worthy of enslavement, it does grant some species special status over others; Gremlins are one such species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins are eligible for &quot;favored servant&quot; status; though they are still subordinate to Goblins, Gremlins that have earned this status are afforded preferential treatment and special privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that have earned this status often serve as faithful retainers, performing tasks that, though they are beneath the dignity of a proper Goblin, still require trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins also often serve as soldiers or mercenaries; Gremlins may keep a rabble of lesser slaves in line, or may guard the vulnerable flanks of the Goblin's highly effective long-spear formations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favored Servant status is often passed down family lines by Gremlins, with parents grooming their offspring to continue in the service of a Goblin King, noble, warlord or family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favored servants often mark their status with tattoos, which might symbolize their lineage, the Goblin line they serve, or their deeds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins are more likely than Goblins to flee the Goblin Empire and settle within the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that <em>do not</em> have &quot;favored servant&quot; status are <em>especially</em> likely to attempt to flee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that <em>were</em> favored servants are likely to receive a cold reception in the Commonwealth, especially among the small communities of Goblins and Gremlins that have settled in free lands, since other Goblin and Gremlin communities in the Commonwealth are likely to view them as traitors, collaborators and thugs.</p>

<h3 id="Raptors"><a class="header-link" href="#Raptors">Raptors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These small creatures, as much like a reptile as a bird, are one of
the races originally inhabiting the Raptor’s Plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They walk upright, are covered in dark-green scales, and feature
vibrant feathers as plumage on their heads, arms, and on their short
tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though they are warm-blooded, they don’t handle extremes of
temperature very well, and are most comfortable in the humid jungles
of Raptor’s Plane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have powerful legs and nasty claws, and are natural climbers
and leapers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, they were a society of tribal hunters: the
young and old lived in settlements, while the healthy ranged and
hunted in the thick jungles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact with the Ratfolk brought them access to worked iron and
bronze, and the two collaborated to adapt Ratfolk farming techniques
to the deep jungle; these have helped revolutionize Raptor culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though many of them are still hunters, they have expanded the scale
of their agriculture significantly, and trade with Ratfolk burrows
for finished weapons and tools.</p>

prey when pounced on from above. The have the following natural
weapon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unarmed Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -2. Tags: Natural, Grab,
Awkward Placement: Legs</li>
<li>Special: Your talons are difficult to use, being on your feet;
they require that you pounce on someone from above, leap on them
and pin them, or use some other similar tactic to bring them to
bear.</li>
<li>Special: Your talons are very good at gripping those you attack,
digging in through flesh and bone as you do so. When attacking
with your talons, if you score an exceptional success, you
automatically grab your opponent.</li>

<h3 id="Washers"><a class="header-link" href="#Washers">Washers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name “washers” was taken from observations of the species by early Commonwealth explorers; “Jerks” is a fair (if polite) translation of the name they have for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washers are small, furry, and semi-humanoid in gross layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are covered in dull, grey-brown fur, with a distinctive black “eye-mask” pattern on their faces and black rings around their bushy tails.</li>
<li>Washers move more naturally on all fours than they do upright; their arms and legs are unusually short and oddly-proportioned by humanoid standards.</li>
<li>Washers have extremely dexterous hands and feet, and they are very strong climbers.</li>
<li>Washers have an extraordinary sense of touch in their hands—so keen that they can better perceive a small object by feeling it than by looking at it.  Members of other races may find it cute when Washers frenetically paw small objects to examine them—and more than a little unnerving when they manipulate fine objects without looking at them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washers lived in a region in the east of the Raptor’s Plane, in the forests that bordered on the sandy, arid northeastern peninsula.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tragically, that sandy, arid northeastern peninsula was the region first conquered by the Goblinoid Kings (and now ruled by the Goblin Empire).</li>
<li>Not long after discovering them, the Goblins attempted to make slaves of the Washers, highly valuing their tiny, dexterous hands; they quickly decided that the Washers’ temperament made them unsuitable for enslavement, and moved instead to eradicate them.</li>
<li>Too late did the Washers ally themselves with the Raptors and join their alliance with the Ratfolk; by this time, they only had one major city left, and a total surviving population of just more than a quarter-million.</li>
<li>Today, the Washer’s territory defines the border between the Raptor’s Alliance and the Goblinoid territories.</li>

<h3 id="BoneSpiders"><a class="header-link" href="#BoneSpiders">Bone Spiders</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bone Spiders are among the more unique races to set foot on the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Spiders are arranged somewhat like crabs or spiders, but much larger; they have a large central section about a meter across, from which six meter-long legs extend.</li>
<li>They have a head section at one end; it is not articulated with a neck, but continuous with the body.</li>
<li>Two arms extend from the front, from slightly below the head, one on either side of it.</li>
<li>They have multiple eyes—two large ones on the head facing forward, and four smaller pairs situated around the head; this arrangement gives them more than 180 degrees of vision, and allows them to see above and below them.</li>
<li>Bone Spiders have large bone plates covering their backs, underbellies and limbs.  There are a half-dozen diamond-shaped plates on their back, which overlap at their edges a little like scale mail; the plates on their underbellies are segmented, arranged in strips.</li>
<li>Bone Spiders are semi-aquatic; they have gills on their underbellies, and can breathe underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers.</li>
<li>Bone Spiders are omnivorous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bone Spiders only recently made contact with the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Spider explorers first discovered the Emerald Plane and the Commonwealth some twenty years ago; a trickle of Bone Spider merchants have followed.</li>
<li>Bone Spiders are from a lone island some two months’ voyage from the eastern coast of the Emerald Plane.</li>
<li>Their island is not large: it is roughly circular, and it would take shy of two weeks to cross it on food at its widest.  The island is rocky and mountainous, rising to a single low peak in its middle.</li>
<li>Along its northern and southern coasts, the rocks descend directly into the sea; besides a few lagoons, there is little arable land.</li>
<li>Along the eastern and western coasts, there are flat stretches, hosting thin bands of soil and greenery between the sandy shores and the rocky slope.</li>
<li>The Bone Spiders earliest culture began in a system of flooded caves and caverns in the center of their island.  Among their earliest myths are the stories of ascending from the deep caves to surface, and then descending form the slopes of the mountain to discover the thin crescents of fertile ground on their eastern and western coasts.</li>
<li>Bone Spiders have long practiced aquaculture in the shallows around their island, and have a long history of boat-building and sailing.</li>
<li>Only within the last hundred years did Bone Spiders begin to develop the kinds of boats that could cross the open ocean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total Bone Spider population is not large; they have largely filled in the habitable portions of their island and the shallows around it, though they number fewer than five hundred thousand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite this fact, they seem in little hurry to expand onto the Emerald Plane.</li>
<li>They do seem eager to trade, however, and a steady trickle of Bone-Spider merchant-ships have docked at ports along the eastern and southern coasts of the Emerald Plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those traders who do encounter these rare creatures should be advised: Bone Spiders find attempts to mimic their culture to be <em>very</em> tiresome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bone Spiders produce several varieties of beer, wine and liquor from the plants they grow in aquaculture; these exotic spirits fetch a high price in the Commonwealth's market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchants who deal with them know that Bone Spiders will not actually drink the spirits that they sell; nor do they mistake the wax-paper containers the wine is stored in as a sign of quality.</li>
