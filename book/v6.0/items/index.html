        <h1>Items</h1>

        <p>Items are broken into five categories: <em>trivial, minor, moderate, major,</em> and <em>extreme</em>. This mainly determines their cost when purchased at character creation. A trivial item is an item of no notable cost: a fork and a candle are trivial items. Notably, you usually shouldn’t purchase a trivial item directly; it’s usually better to buy a <em>skill kit</em> for a relevant skill than to purchase a bunch of trivial-cost items directly. A <em>minor</em> item is a single, useful item or piece of gear, like a grappling-hook or ladder. A <em>moderate</em> item is a notable item—any one weapon or piece of armor would be a medium item, as would a skill kit (see below). A <em>major</em> item plays a major roll in defining a character; this might include a magic weapon, an heirloom, a shop or a plot of land. An extreme item is exceedingly rare, exceedingly expensive, or both; a noble estate is an extreme item. (Each category corresponds to a cost level, from 1 to 5; this is compared to a character’s wealth level while bartering.)</p>
<p>The mages and artisans of the Commonwealth have a servicable command of
magic; while magical items tend to be rarer and more expensive than
non-magical ones, a number of common magical items (and potions) are
commonly available throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Notably, we provide no specific rules for designing major items,
especially magical ones; these items should be designed to suit specific
player’s preferences, and this is a process that the GM and player
should do cooperatively.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this game is intended to be less gear-focused
than other fantasy adventure games (that is, for example, D&amp;D). The
intent is that a character is mostly defined by their Skills first, and
by their Traits, Race, Backgrounds, Classes and Powers second.</p>
<p>Some items have keywords. Most of these keywords do not have affects
themselves, but do interact with traits, powers and other rules.</p>
<p>Several of these items are heavy or cumbersome. Rather than attempting
to track item weight in detail, items that are particularly bulky are
given the <em>Heavy</em> keyword. To determine how many <em>Heavy</em> items a
character can carry without penalty, divide their STR by 10 and round
down. For every additional <em>Heavy</em> item beyond this number, the
character suffers a -10 penalty to all physical actions. Other affects
(such as fatigue or immobility) may be applied at GM discretion.</p>

<h2 id="Armors"><a class="header-link" href="#Armors">Armors</a></h2>
<p>The following listings are for common types of armor. Each entry is for
a full <em>suit</em> or <em>set</em> of the given armor type (that is, helmets,
gauntlets and grieves are not purchased separately).</p>
<p>Armor is often heavy and cumbersome, and it is not normally possible to
wear more than one suit of armor at a time. <strong>Layerable</strong> armors are an
exception: they can be worn under (or sometimes over) other armors to
provide an additional benefit. Besides your primary armor, you can wear
a second set of armor under or over it, but only if the second set has
the layerable tag.</p>
<p>Most people only wear armor if they are either going into battle or are
performing some ceremonial role; wearing armor while eating, dinner or
doing business would be considered extremely unusual at best (which
might impose penalties to social skills checks, and would make it nearly
impossible to blend into a crowd). <strong>Sociable</strong> armors are an exception;
either because they are accepted as normal attire in some cultures, or
because they are not obvious as armor, they can be worn in social
situations without seeming strange.</p>
<p>Some armors provide protection at the cost of impairing movement,
whether by virtue of being heavy, or rigid, or awkwardly placed; these
armors have the <strong>Cumbersome</strong> tag.</p>
<p>Most armors cover most of the wearer’s body, including their head and
extremities. Some armor, however, leaves large portions of the wearer
exposed; these armors have the <strong>Exposed</strong> tag.</p>
<p>It was “Armor with the Exposed tag provides no protection on a critical
hit,” but I think that’s too extreme if we want people to actually use
partial plate. Honestly, at this point, I think maybe some of these tags
don’t need a fixed rule, so I might just ad-hoc it for the Partial
Plate.</p>
<p>Some armor (and other outfits) are particularly good at concealing their
wearer. Armor with the <strong>Stealthy</strong> tag provides the wearer with a +10
bonus to Stealth checks.</p>
<p>Similarly, some armors (and other garments) obscure the wearer, making
it difficult to identify them. Armor with the <strong>Concealing</strong> tag
provides the wearer with a +10 bonus when attempting to blend into a
crowd. They also imposes a -20 penalty on characters making Perception
to pick the wearer out of a crowd, they make it impossible to detect
items concealed with Slight of Hand, and impose a -30 penalty on Read
checks made against the wearer. These penalties do not apply to
characters who can stop and search the wearer, such as a captor.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what to do with the <del>Concealable</del> Stealthy tag. One
solution is to add an implicit stealth <em>penalty</em> to every other armor; I
don’t like that because it reinforces the whole “no armor for stealth
characters” thing (which might make sense but still feels formulaic). On
the other hand, if we add a stealth bonus to leather armor, that really
doesn’t make sense either: why would wearing leather armor be stealthier
than wearing, say, black clothing? We could fix <em>that</em> by adding a
“sneak suit” that’s just dark or camoflaged clothing and provides a
stealth bonus, but now every stealth build has a fixed +10 stealth bonus
from one of those items. Of all of those, I think I hate the last one
the least. … oh fuck, if we add a stealth suit, we’ll have to have a
rule somewhere that you can’t wear it with armor.</p>
<p>Some armor is especially visible, ostentatious or prominent; this is
often true of armors that have a ritual or ceremonial role, or armors
that are commonly worn during competition. Characters wearing armor with
the <strong>Proud</strong> tag will stand out in combat, and may be more likely to be
targeted by an enemy. This tag may not do enough to keep.</p>
<h3 id="QuiltedArmor"><a class="header-link" href="#QuiltedArmor">Quilted Armor</a></h3>
<p>A doublet or jacket consisting of layering material around thick wadding
in order to protect the wielder from impacts. An outer layer of dense
cotton weave or cured leather also protect the wearer from cuts and
scrapes. They are considered normal outer wear for the nobility of both
the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire, and for guards and soldiers
deployed in cities.</p>
<p>Armor Value: 2 AV</p>
<p>Drawbacks: None</p>
<p>Tags: Layerable, Sociable</p>
<h3 id="LeatherArmor"><a class="header-link" href="#LeatherArmor">Leather Armor</a></h3>
<p>Boiled, hardened leather worn as a light plate. It is easily darkened
for use in the shadows, and is light enough to not require any special
training or impair the wearer's mobility. It lacks the protective
capacity of heavier armors, though.</p>
<p>Armor Value: 4 AV</p>
<p>Drawbacks: None</p>
<p>Tags: Stealthy</p>
<h3 id="MailArmour"><a class="header-link" href="#MailArmour">Mail Armour</a></h3>
<p>A flexible covering of metal made of interlocking rings. Intricate, but
relatively quick to weave and manufacture from the proper wire stock and
effective at stretching limited supplies of metal. Though its
flexibility makes it easier to wear, chainmail hangs heavily from the
wearer and is less effective at dispersing impacts.</p>
<p>Armor Value: 5 AV</p>
<p>Drawbacks: -5 to checks that include your COO.</p>
<p>Tags: Heavy</p>
<h3 id="Brigandine"><a class="header-link" href="#Brigandine">Brigandine</a></h3>
<p>Something of a mid-point between mail and plate armors, brigandine armor
consists of oblong, overlapping metal plates molded to the wearer. There
are a number of methods for holding the plates in place; one common
technique is to rivet them to a leather or fabric vest, providing a
distinctive appearance. It is somewhat easier to slip between the
individual plates with piercing weapons.</p>
<p>Armor Value: 7 armor</p>
<p>Drawbacks: -10 to checks that include your COO.</p>

### Partial Plate (Original)

Consisting of steel plates and leather straps, partial plate protects
only parts of the wearer. The typical layout will cover the throat,
shoulders, arms and shins in plate, though other arrangements exist,
including single plates directly over the heart and kidneys, or
gladiator sleeves.

Armor Value: 5 AV

Drawbacks: Cannot be worn with Full Plate.

Tags: Exposed, Layerable, Proud

Exposed makes sense but is (probably) awkward to manage at the table; 5
AV is way too much to be Layerable without penalty.

### Partial Plate (Edited 1)

Consisting of steel plates and leather straps, partial plate protects
only parts of the wearer. The typical layout will cover the throat,
shoulders, arms and shins in plate, though other arrangements exist,
including single plates directly over the heart and kidneys, or
gladiator sleeves.

Armor Value: 3 AV

Drawbacks: -2 INIT if layered with armor with the Heavy tag. Cannot be
worn with Full Plate.

<p>A full set of plate armor is among the best protection available.
Coating the wearer's body in solid plates of refined steel, it is worn
by the noble knights of the Dragonshire and Kingdoms, and by the
Commonwealth’s fearsome shock troops. The weight of the metal armour
makes some motions sluggish, but does not impair gross agility or
strength.</p>

<h2 id="Weapons"><a class="header-link" href="#Weapons">Weapons</a></h2>
<p>The following is a sampling of the weapons in use throughout the world.
It is by no means complete; GMs and players should feel free to create
whatever specific weapons they desire by starting with a similar weapon
from the list and making changes as necessary.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be used <strong>One-Handed</strong>, while others require a
<strong>Two-Handed</strong> grip; still others are worn rather than held (and this
have the <strong>No-Handed</strong> tag).</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at parrying, guarding or deflecting
attacks; these weapons have the <strong>Defensive</strong> tag. When you use such a
weapon to defend yourself, you gain a +10 bonus. Conversely, some
weapons may be awkward, clumsy or fragile—or, in the case of ranged
weapons, may not be designed to <em>strike</em> an opponent at all—and thus it
is very awkward to defend yourself while carrying them; these weapons
have the <strong>Vulnerable</strong> tag. You take a -10 penalty to your defense when
wielding such a weapon.</p>
<p>Similar to Vulnerability, some weapons, though they may be effective,
hinder your ability to move about; these weapons have the <strong>Awkward</strong>
tag. Awkward weapons impose a -10 penalty to* movement skills* while you
are wielding them.</p>
<p>Some weapons, commonly pole-arms, have a particularly long reach, which
provides a notable advantage; these weapons have the <strong>Reach</strong> tag.
Reach weapons can attack an opponent who is 1m further away (that is, if
you are using a combat grid with 1m sqaures, then you can attack people
who are 1 square away). Reach weapons also do not suffer a penalty for
attacking a mounted character.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly good at preventing an opponent from
closing; these weapons have the <strong>Fend</strong> tag. If you have such a weapon
and an opponent comes within reach of you, you can make an <em>attack of
opportunity</em> against them (normally, you could only make an attack of
opportunity if they attempted to move away from or past you.) This uses
all the normal rules for an attack-of-opportunity, including counting as
a reaction.</p>
<p>Some weapons can be braced, and used to receive a charge; these weapons
have the <strong>Brace</strong> tag. See <em>Charging</em> in <em>Combat</em> for the rules for
bracing to receive a charge.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly easy to use; these weapons have the
<strong>Easy</strong> tag. Such weapons receive a +10 bonus on attack checks.
Conversely, some weapons are very <em>difficult</em> to use; they have the
<strong>Difficult</strong> tag, and receive a -10 penalty on attack checks.</p>
<p>Some weapons are well-suited to a particular combat maneuver; these
weapons have the <strong>Well-Suited</strong> tag. The Well-Suited tag will always
include the specific maneuver that a weapon is used with, written as
“Well-Suited: Trip”. When using a well-suited weapon, you do not take
the listed penalty when attempting the given maneuver.</p>
<p>Many weapons are particularly difficult to use in confined spaces, where
drawing and swinging a weapon is difficult. Some weapons, however, can
be used effectively even when you have very little room to maneuver.
Weapons with the <strong>Close</strong> tag can be used in confined spaces without
penalty.</p>
<p>Weapons with the <strong>Small</strong> tag can also be used in confined spaces by
virtue of their size; however, they have other drawbacks, including
their lack of reach compared to other weapons (which imposes a -10
penalty to your attack and defense when fighting a character with a
reach advantage).</p>
<p>Most weapons are awkward (at best) to use while mounted; some, however,
make excellent mounted weapons. These weapons have the <strong>cavalry</strong> tag;
see <em>Mounted Combat</em> in <em>Combat</em> for details.</p>
<p>Some weapons are particularly able to bypass a defender’s guard; these
weapons have the <strong>Bypass</strong> tag, and impose a -20 penalty to the
defender’s defense.</p>
<p>This is the point where I ran out of energy. The ones that are left are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prone: this weapon can be used just as effectively while prone.</li>
<li>Loud: this weapon is very loud; it will be obvious to anyone in the
area when it is used.</li>
<li>Single-Use: some weapons are designed to be used only once; after a
single shot (if a ranged weapon) or single hit (if a melee weapon),
the weapon becomes useless.</li>
<li>Soak: this weapon is particularly well-suited to delivering poisons.</li>
<li>Grip: this weapon improves grip while grappling. (Doesn’t this only
possibly apply to the wraps?)</li>
<li>Secure: this weapon is very difficult to disarm.</li>
<li>… actually, it’s true in general that not every tag has to have a
rule. Hmm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these should really be rewritten to just punt to the rules in
Combat. This includes at least Reach and Brace.</p>
<h2 id="NoHandedWeapons"><a class="header-link" href="#NoHandedWeapons">No-Handed Weapons</a></h2>
<p>No-handed weapons are typically <em>worn</em>, like clawed or spiked gauntlets.
Though they put a wielder at a disadvantage against someone with a
longer weapon (which will give their opponent and advantage in reach and
leverage), they do have the certain advantages—including that some of
them are not obvious as weapons.</p>
<h3 id="HandWraps"><a class="header-link" href="#HandWraps">Hand Wraps</a></h3>
<p>Wrapping a character's hands and/or feet in thin material to provide
better grip will benefit a grappler; some users might also soak the
materials in chemicals or toxins.</p>

<p>Sapper gloves are simple leather gloves that have had a heavier, stiffer

<p>Plated Gloves with individual fingers ending in bladed claws, with

weapons have since spread widely.</p>

<p>One-handed weapons are simple to drill with, and allow a deal of
flexibility. A person with a one-handed weapon can use their free hand
to carry a shield, a second weapon, or activate devices like Torches or
levers. A single hand on the weapon means the wielder will lack the
leverage and raw power of a two-handed weapon, though certain one-handed
weapons can match the reach of polearms, or be thrown as ranged weapons.</p>
<h3 id="Knife"><a class="header-link" href="#Knife">Knife</a></h3>
<p>Knives are small, concealable weapons that come in a great variety of
designs and styles; the example here is a short blade with a single
edge. Some knives can be throw effectively. Many knives are not designed
primarily for use as weapons; they are commonly carried as utility items
by woodsman and craftsmen. Knives are commonly used by assassins and
criminals, so many knives feature channels on the blade that can hold
poisons, or hollowed handles that can be used to hold small items or
messages.</p>

<p>A small blade similar to a knife, save that it is longer and

assist in parrying and defense.</p>
<p>Notably, many Shade Elves practice an energetic and mobile fighting
style that uses daggers; the style has been inherited (and modified) by
Ash Elves as well.</p>

<p>A short sword is any sword of up to 75cm in length, with a short handle
and large pommel. Short swords are a classic military sidearm used by
countless cultures throughout the Emerald Plane. Though they are
heavier, more difficult to wield and more expensive than other weapons
of comparable length, they are also more versatile; they can be used to
thrust and parry as well as slash, and so they can be used in tight
quarters, can be used defensively and can be used to make very precise
attacks.</p>
<p>Arming swords are a ubiquitous sidearm wielded by Commonwealth troops;
they have a single edge, which comes to a sharpened point at the end;
they are suitable for slashing and thrusting, and thanks in part to
being single-edged they are cheap to produce in large numbers, even when
manufactured at the high levels of quality for which the Commonwealth is
known.</p>

<h3 id="WarAxe"><a class="header-link" href="#WarAxe">War Axe</a></h3>
<p>A war axe is any axe of up to 60cm, with either a single or double head.
War axes are common weapons found throughout the cultures of the Emerald
Plane; most consist of a long, wooden heft with a single metal blade at
the end. They are common because they are easy and cheap to make,
because they are effective even when made with poor metal, and because
they require little training for a user to be minimally effective.
Because much of their length is wooden, axes are lighter and faster than
swords—though they also offer more force behind a blow, because they are
heavily weighted towards the head. For the same reason, they are
slightly more capable of defeating armor, thanks to focusing a greater
force on a smaller point of impact.</p>
<p>Goblins make particularly common use of war axes, owing to their lack of
access to high-quality steel. In recent years, some Goblin smiths have
begun to attach a hook, hammer-point or spike to the back of the weapon,
intended for use against armored targets.</p>

<p>A spear is essentially a metal point affixed to a shaft anywhere from
one to two-and-a-half meters long, designed for thrusting, pushing and

the bone-spiders to the two-meter-long steel-pointed spears commonly
used by the troops of the Goblin Empire when they fight in formation, to
the simple iron or stone-tipped spears used by countless tribal
cultures.</p>
<p>Short spears can be used one or two-handed, and are particularly

devices for inflicting injury to an opponent. However, the lack of a

<p>A longbow is a bow that is 180cm in length or more. Longbows require

wielder to be raised to it, and so only cultures that have a “culture of
the bow” can boast many longbowmen.</p>
<p>The Herders have such a “culture of the bow,” and Herder longbowmen have
long provided the Commonwealth with a powerful advantage in their
conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples—despite the Herder’s relative lack
of brute strength. This era may be coming to a close, however, as

implies, are much like miniature cannons; they consist of a barrel, a
chamber with a hole tapped into it, and a socket to which a longer
wooden grip is attached. The cannon is loaded by packing powder and a
projectile down the barrel, and fired by holding a lit object up to the
touch hole. Though a wide variety of projectiles can be used with
hand-cannons—among them arrows and rocks—metal balls manufactured
specifically for the purpose have become common.</p>
<p>Hand-cannons are heavy and awkward; while it is possible to hold it with
one hand and touch off the weapon with the other, it is difficult to do.
In practice, the weapons are often used by a pair of soldiers: one who
holds and aims the weapon while the other touches it off.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth are the heaviest users of these weapons, with the
Goblin Empire being a close second.</p>

<p>Whips are common tools for managing livestock and work-animals;
they consist of long, slender pieces of tanned leather.
Though they are very painful, they are not nearly as dangerous as purpose-built weapons, they are all but useless against even the slightest armor, and cannot be used to parry or defend against a close attacker.
Nevertheless, some do use them for self-defense, as a less-lethal weapon, to disarm opponents or to move small objects at range.</p>

<p><em>The Dragon’s Axe is an example unique weapon. As the description says, the Dragon’s Axe allows the wielder access to at least one powerful, armor-defeating shot, without leaving them defenseless in melee combat. Such a weapon might have an unreliable firing mechanism, or it might have a weaker shaft (owing to it being hollow to double as a barrel)—or it also might not! The weapon might be perfectly servicable as both an axe and matchlock. The choice is up to the player and the GM, and depends on what the CP cost of the weapon is, and what kind of “feel” the GM wants for the setting, and the player wants for their character.</em></p>
<p>A unique weapon built to order at great expense to the Dragonshire noble
that commissioned it, it was designed to make the might of gunpowder
available to its wielder without leaving them vulnerable in
close-combat. The axe’s shaft is reinforced, and also serves as the
barrel of a projectile weapon; the handle has a sophisticated,
matchlock-like mechanism to trigger the weapon.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Magical items largely follow the same rules as non-magical ones;</p>
<ul>
<li>they are listed separately here because, unlike ladders and
rope, they require descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low Cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light: this small glass vile contains a clear liquid. When
shaken, it produces a bright light: it shines brightly enough
that a character holding it can see clearly for 20m around them.
Once it is lit, it will continue to shine brightly for 20
minutes, and then dimly for 20 minutes thereafter—although
shaking it again will cause it to begin shining brightly once
more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderate Cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heater: this small magical apparatus is used to generate strong
heat; it is commonly carried by travelers who use them to keep
warm, to boil water and to start fires. Heaters are cylindrical
metal devices about the size and shape of the handle to a
hammer; the tip of one end is lain with intricate steel wiring,
while the other end is wrapped in leather. When the device is
activated, the wired tip becomes extremely hot. The device
requires a charge, a narrow alchemical rod that is fed into the
handle end. One charge is Trivial cost and will run the heater
for 2 hours. While there is a charge in it, the heater can be
activated and deactivated with a metal trigger in the grip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe-Fall Cape: this cape billows outward as you fall, and both
it’s physical size and magical effects cooperate to slow your
fall. No matter how far you fall, the cape will prevent you from
falling faster than a quick run. When you land, you must make an
athletics check: if you succeed, you ake no damage, but if you
fail, you take 1d10 dv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Torque of Speaking: you may use one additional language group
(pick one when purchasing this item).</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the torque is giving you access to a language
group, and not ranks in a specific language. If you’re a
human, you can use a torque to make the sounds needed to
speak Gnollish (in the language-group GR), but you’d still
need to have ranks in Language: Heartland Gnoll to actually
speak that language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1d10-2 DV, Ignores Armor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Range: 30m (short) / 50m / 70m</li>
<li>Requires 10 ranks in Spellcraft to use (no check is
required)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this potentially fun or stupid?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warmblood Suit: this heavy outfit resembles heavy winter
clothing, with an outer layer of wool and an linen inner lining.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just inside the linen lining there is a wrapping like a
metallic ribbon; at several points along the back, there are
pockets containing more of the metallic ribbons. Both sets
of ribbons cross are connected to two magical mechanisms,
each a twin of the other, in the back of the suit.</li>
<li>In extreme cold, the external ribbons are left rolled up in
their pockets. When activated, the inner ribbons heat up,
warming the wearer.</li>
<li>In extreme heat, the wearer opens the pockets and unfurls
the ribbons, and the garment then pumps heat <em>out</em> through
the unfurled ribbons, cooling the wearer.</li>
<li>If worn by a <em>warm-blooded</em> creature, the survival suit
provides a +20 bonus to <em>Endure Physical Hardship</em> tests to
survive extreme weather.</li>
<li>If worn by a <em>cold-blooded</em> creature, the survival suit
allows the wearer to endure extremes of temperature as well
as a warm-blooded creature.</li>
<li>The garment itself is tough, and provides some protection
from damage. It has an armor value of 2 and has the
Concealing, Layerable and Sociable tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major Cost</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Bronze Arm: a magical item crafted for General Chandra to
replace an arm lost in combat, this finely-crafted and mighty
device has only made the general stronger.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arm provides Chandra with +5 DUR, +5 STR and +2 AV.</li>
<li>Even though it is functionally a part of Chandra’s body, and
he wields it as his own arm, it is still so powerful and
durable that it counts as a weapon. Chandra can attack with
it using either the One-Handed Weapons or Unarmed skills,
and he is always considered armed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hunter’s Bow: a magical bow carried by Aryn the hunter, it
fires bolts of light rather than arrows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since the bow fires magical projectiles that it generates,
it does not require ammo. (Note, we normally do not track
“basic” ammo, so this detail is as much a narrative point
as a functional rule.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides functioning normally as a shortbow, the Hunter’s Bow
has two alternate modes, controlled by a catch hidden in the
wraps where Aryn grips it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In “light” mode, the fired bolts do no damage, but they
instead stick to whatever they strike and persist for
several minutes, glowing brightly the entire time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In “track” mode, the bolt also does no damage and also
sticks to whatever target it strikes—but in track mode, the
bolt can last for up to 72 hours, although only one tracker
can be active at a time. Rather than glowing brightly,
tracking bolts are invisible (except, of course, to someone
with Mage Sight). Being struck with a tracker bow feels
somewhat like being pinched, but is otherwise harmless and
painless.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bow pulses gently based on the whether the bow is
facing towards the target, and it’s range; this allows
Aryn to use the bow to track a target struck by a
tracker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Oil can be put out by washing it off, covering a burning
object in sand, or even by rolling on the ground.</li>

<li>Tags: Magical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scour (Chemical, Bomb):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scour is highly caustic; it will dissolve most solid
objects, and will cause terrible chemical burns to flesh and
bone.</p>
<ul>
<li>An object or character covered in Scout takes 1D10 DV
per turn.</li>
<li>Scour is very difficult to stop; it is thick and sticky,
and difficult to remove.</li>
<li>Fortunately, Scour dissolves in water, making it very
easy to wash off (if water is available).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If ingested, Scour is lethal; it deals 3D10 DV per turn
until the character dies; fortunately, it is visually
distinct (being a thick, pale, greenish paste), and the
taste is obvious (and <em>horrible</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scour doesn’t dissolve glass; therefore, a bottle of it can
be thrown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack: Thrown Weapon, Splash 1D10÷2m</li>
<li>Tags: Splash, Caustic</li>
<li>Anything in the Splash is covered in Scour.</li>

<p>Tar (Chemical, Bomb):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This thick, black, viscous and sticky substance burns
intensely when lit; when burning, it is very difficult to
put out.</p>
<ul>
<li>If an object is covered in burning tar, it takes 1D10÷2
DV per turn.</li>
<li>Tar is very difficult to extinguish. Dropping and
rolling will not extinguish it, and neither will pouring
water on it.</li>
<li>Submersing an object in water will put the fire out, but
the tar will remain hot for some time, and might
re-ignite when exposed to air again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tar is often prepared in a glass or clay container with a
lit wick, creating a device like a Cocktail:</p>

<li>some skills can't be practiced <em>without</em> a skill kit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>have the tools useful to perform that skill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: when you buy a skill kit, you may specify three Minor items
that the kit definitely contains.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to do this, but it can be useful for declaring
that you <em>definitely</em> have a specific item, without requiring
you to buy many Minor or Trivial items.</li>
<li>for example, with a Craft: Blacksmithing kit, you might specify
that it <em>definitely</em> contains a blacksmithing hammer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shops are more extensive facilities; they function like Skill Kits,
but they allow users to pursue larger or longer-term projects. Shops
provide a +10 bonus on tests using the linked skill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CreatingItems"><a class="header-link" href="#CreatingItems">Creating Items</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Characters can use their Craft skills to create items directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This requires an appropriate <em>skill kit</em> and raw materials to
work with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This requires the character succeed on an appropriate Craft
check.</p>

<li>Creating a <em>Significant Magic Item</em> also requires a
Spellcraft check.</li>

<li>Minor Item: two hour Task Action</li>
<li>Moderate Item: <del>one day</del> 1 shift Job</li>
<li>Major Item: <del>one month</del> 20 shift Job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Characters need raw materials to make things—but how do you
determine if characters have raw materials? There isn’t a Raw
Materials item, and there aren’t rules for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our answer is: assume they have raw materials, unless there’s a
very good reason that they don’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if they’ve had to flee their homes at short
notice, if they’ve been traveling light for days, or if
they’ve been captured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If GMs (or players) want a more definite system for tracking raw
materials, see Raw Materials in Optional Rules.</p>
