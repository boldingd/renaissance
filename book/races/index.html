        <h1>Races</h1>

        <p>There are three separate keywords that have special significance in Race
entries. All races will have one of the following keywords: Natural,
Supernatural or Spirit. This tells you whether the race is
flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality
(Supernatural), or is composed entirely of magical energy (Spirit).</p>
<p>Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds. You
don’t acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of
options at character creation, and you may <em>optionally</em> select them
using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or
Backgrounds during character creation. (So, for example, Shifters don't
<em>just have</em> the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during
character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible
for.)</p>
<p>Game Design Note: narrowing the stuff you get in Races down to <em>only</em>
what every member of that species would have, regardless of background.
Moving other features (c.f. skill bonuses) to backgrounds. Adding
Optional Backgrounds to races that have unique sub-cultures (like Ash
Elves, Herders or Dwarves).</p>
<p>Game Design Note: races selection should be interesting, and should
affect how you play the character. However, you shouldn’t have to pick a
specific race to get a specific feature or be good at a specific job.
This is why many abilities were moved to Backgrounds, and why many
abilities are being replaced by Traits-for-free (so that any other Race
can just take the Trait if they want to).</p>
<h2 id="CommonRaces"><a class="header-link" href="#CommonRaces">Common Races</a></h2>
<h3 id="Drakes"><a class="header-link" href="#Drakes">Drakes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though it was long known that the Drakes where a created people, it
was only a few hundred years ago, as power devolved to the people in
the Dragonshire and as their alliance with the Commonwealth drew
closer, that their true origin was revealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than a century before the Old Charter, after Karrach claimed a
swath of the Empire of Man, it had become apparent to him that he
could not govern such a large territory on his own.</p>
<ul>
<li>He had called other dragons to him, to share the rule of his
kingdom as his lords and vassals, but dragons, though long-lived
and mighty, where also few, and had little shared culture or
history before his kingdom. Karrach need a <em>people</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karrach, aided by the dragons who answered his call, began a search
for a powerful spirit willing to provide him a great boon—for a
great price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, a spirit contacted him; it variably identified itself as <em>the Bulrush God</em>, <em>the Rainstorm Shepherd</em> and <em>the Osprey’s Father</em>, and it dwelt within the southern reaches of the Dragonshire.</li>
<li>The spirit’s actual basin remains unknown, as does the extent of
its powers; they are certainly great, given what it did.</li>
<li>It gave Karrach and his followers instructions for creating holy
sites—only the precious first few of which it has actually
blessed—and a ritual they could perform there. The ritual would
convert a dragon’s egg into a drake’s egg—drakes being creatures
of dragon’s blood and kind, but smaller, less mighty and far
more fertile.</li>
<li>The price the Bulrush God demanded was perhaps surprisingly
cheap for what it did: it demanded ownership of a stretch of
lowland marsh on the southern coast of the Dragonshire, fully 20
kilometers along the coast and extending 7 kilometers inland,
and a lordly title.</li>
<li>This represented an enormous risk for Karrach, as he knew of no
way to bind the spirit, which was unknown to him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bulrush God is still worshiped in the Dragonshire.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bulrush God is enigmatic; very little is known about it,
neither its actual basin nor the true extent of its powers nor
its ultimate goals.</li>
<li>The Bulrush God answers very few supplicants; it is not known
what draws it. No bind for it is known—unsurprisingly, for a
spirit of its power.</li>
<li>Conversely, the Bulrush God interferes little in the affairs of
mortals and lesser spirits. Particularly, it has never used its
lordly title, and it has not allowed settlement of the land it
claims, and so has no subjects. (Neither has it forbidden the
land to hunters or travelers, leading many to wonder what its
actual intent with it was.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes frequently trace their lineages back to their Dragon
forebears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each egg needed to be live; thus, all Drakes have at least two
dragon ancestors, one male and one female.</li>
<li>The ritual to transform an egg required a price of each
participant dragon; it was not undertaken lightly.</li>
<li>Though Drakes can nominally be broken into clans based on their
lineage, their familiy trees where often rendered <em>complex</em> by
feudal politics; for some, their clan and heritage are important
parts of who they are; other drakes care little—or may not even
know their ancestry at all.</li>
<li>Many Drake clans (or smaller noble families) claim noble titles
and land-holdings—at least in principle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
to take positions of authority, above Humans but below Dragons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
(of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of “noble blood”,
and many of them still hold hereditary titles – which may or may not
be of practical significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
neighboring state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean “blacksmithing” more
often than it means “farm work”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
proud and stubborn at worst.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
head, long tail, powerful limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
Dragons. {It may be better to say they look like Dragons, except for
being roughly humanoid in shape and size.)</p>

<h3 id="Elves"><a class="header-link" href="#Elves">Elves</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elves are a common people throughout the Emerald Plains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elves are humanoid in gross layout, although they have finer
features (including long, pointed ears).</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves have excellent hearing and vision.</li>
<li>Notably, elves are descended from arboreal creatures, and retain
prehensile feet. These are larger than human feet, owing to
being reinforced with extra tendons, bones and musculature;
thanks to this reinforcement, Elves can run on open ground as
well as humans.</li>
<li>Elves also have exotic skin pigmentations, which help them to
blend in to natural environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three major Elven ethnic groups: Wood Elves, Shade Elves
and Ash Elves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood Elves are a tribal culture, dispersed throughout the
northwestern portion of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood Elves do not have a large, overarching nation; their tribes
are usually more similar to nearby tribes of other races than to
distant Wood Elves.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth’s interactions with wood elves have, for the
most part, been peaceful; by the present day, the majority of
the wood elf tribes have signed the Commonwealth Charter (and
now the Commonwealth Compact).</li>
<li>However, most wood elf communities continue to practice
traditional, tribal ways of life; they live within the vast
interior swaths of the Emerald Plane, having little contact with
outsiders, even though they are technically Commonwealth
citizens.</li>
<li>Because of this, wood elves are rarely seen outside of their
tribal communities.</li>
<li>Wood Elves typically live in small settlements, with a few
planted fields around them. The able-bodied typically herd or
hunt, while the very young, the very old and the infirm live in
their settlements.</li>
<li>Wood Elves have a complex skin pattern, a little like an ocelot.
Their bellies, underarms and inner thighs are a dull white,
while their backs, arms and legs are a dark green. Running
through this is a complex pattern of black spots and folding and
curving lines. Their hair is often dark green or black; rarely,
it is gold or orange.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shade Elves are plains raiders hailing from the open plains on the
southwest of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the arrival of the Commonwealth, they preyed on the
peoples and cultures near them, forcing some to pay tribute and
raiding the others without mercy.</li>
<li>As the Commonwealth spread West and entered the Shade Elves’
territory, some of the tribes they had preyed upon allied with
those Commonwealth settlers.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth built a string of walled cities and fortified
keeps on the path to the sea; after a disastrous siege led to a
losing war, the Shade Elves’ territory was severely restricted.</li>
<li>This left the Shade Elves vulnerable to the Leapers, a
subterranean race that overwhelmed their largest settlements and
forced the Shade Elves to pay them tribute.</li>
<li>The Leapers later forced the Shade Elves to cooperate with their
other tributaries, the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles; the
resulting union came to be called the Shaded Sea Peoples, named
for the sea that separated the Warren Isles from the Shade
Elves’ territory on the southwest of the continent.</li>
<li>Shade Elves are still raiders, striking at settlements on the
edge of the Commonwealth and on the northwest of the Raptor’s
Plane.</li>
<li>They also participate in piracy, carried by Ratfolk ships and
sailors.</li>
<li>As members of the Shaded Sea Peoples, they are one of the
Emerald Plane’s great powers, and an enemy of the Commonwealth.
They have been in conflict with the Commonwealth off-and-on for
centuries.</li>
<li>Shade Elves live in small settlements dug into the bases of
hills and the sides of mesas and river-valleys. Their
settlements are usually fortified and walled, both to help
fending of rebellions by their tributaries and predation at the
hands of other Shade Elf clans.</li>
<li>Shade Elven skin is striped, a little like a tiger or zebra. The
stripes alternate between a dark black and a dull grey. Shade
Elven hair is similarly black and grey.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ash Elves are urban, thoughtful and philosophical people; they are
the descendants of Shade and Ash Elves who settled in the Haven
Isles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many trace the origins of the Ash Elves to the siege of
Islandholme by the Shade Elves in CY 447 and its aftermath, as
Shade Elves taken hostage in the siege where slowly ingtegrated
into the Commonwealth and interbred with Wood Elves.</li>
<li>Ash Elven settlements have also absorbed many refugees from the
tumult and cruelty of Shade Elven culture, and have served as a
familiar home for Wood Elves wishing to join a more urban
culture.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture was formed in the cities of the Haven Isles,
influenced by the countless other traditions brought there by
settlers from the rest of the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elves are a very thoughtful people, and they are avid
consumers of literature, art, law, philosophy, and other forms
of scholarship. They also tend to be highly eclectic in the
scholarship they consume, drawing for the intellectual
traditions of races and cultures throughout the commonwealth.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is disciplined, mindful and meditative; they
are often reserved, stoic in the face of danger, but vibrant and
joyous in time of celebration.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to prefer urban environs, and can be found
throughout the Commonwealth’s large cities.</li>
<li>Ash Elves have also built cities of their own; they tend to
build large underground settlements, somewhat like those
constructed by Dwarves and Kobolds.</li>
<li>Ash Elven culture is open, egalitarian and libertine; guests are
welcome and well-treated, and they tend to get along well with
their neighbors—especially dwarves and kobolds.</li>
<li>They are particularly known for the joyous celebrations that
mark their holidays, in which their cities are brightly
decorated and travelers and neighbors are welcome.</li>
<li>Ash Elves tend to be strong advocates for the Commonwealth’s
continued peaceful expansion.</li>
<li>Ash Elven skin is mostly the color of ash, as the name implies;
they have a few stripes along their backs, the tops of their
arms, and the outside of their legs. The stripes are thing, and
alternate between white and black. Their hair is often black,
ash grey, pale white or ember orange.</li>

<h3 id="Gnolls"><a class="header-link" href="#Gnolls">Gnolls</a></h3>
<p>Gnolls are one of the most numerous races on the Emerald Plane; much like Humans and Elves, they have long lived throughout the Emerald Plane.
Almost as sociable as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength (and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Gnolls are roughly humanoid in gross layout, but they have hyena-like features:
their head and feet are much like a hyena's;
they are covered in short, ochre fur much like a hyena's;
and they have a hyena's short tail.
Gnolls are also much larger and stronger than most other races—Drakes are perhaps the only common race that can exceed them.
Notably, Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than most other races do; as a result, Gnollish cultures tend to place less importance on an individual's sex.</p>
<p>Gnolls where one of the three races that cooperated under the auspices of the Old Charter to create the growing, prosperous culture of towns, manors and cities that would eventually become the Commonwealth.
When Gnollish refugees where granted a manor's charter by the Lord of a Human city, a new and unique culture was created, at least as similar to the urban Human culture that sheltered them as to any prior Gnollish culture;
this Gnollish culture was one of the ones that was spread west as the Commonwealth expanded, and that is still one of the Commonwealth's most common and distinctive cultures today.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Gnolls tend to be somewhat rural; they are common in the small villages and towns of the Commonwealth, but rare in its cities.
Though the idea of a Gnollish farmer may seem odd to some, they are in fact well-suited to it; their great strength and endurance is invaluable for farming work, and the <em>flexibility</em> of their diet can be invaluable in lean years.
(Though Gnolls are meat-eaters, they have discovered a number of useful recipes involving grains that provide them at least some nourishment, which they can use to greatly stretch meat reserves.)</p>
<p>Though Gnolls may be somewhat rustic by Commonwealth standards, their communities nevertheless tend to be open and welcoming;
their ancestor's flight from persecution at the hands of their cousins, and their salvation at the hands of people strange and alien to them—Humans—is very much alive in Gnollish culture, and strongly informs their traditions and values to this day.</p>
<p>Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races feel comfortable around them.
Many Gnollish communities have two separate set of customs, one for when members of other races are around, and one for when they're not.
For example, Gnolls are carrion-eaters, and many other races may be revolted by some of the things that Gnolls may eat; for this reason, Gnollish communities often have a recipe of &quot;guest-food,&quot; which both they and their guests can eat.
Gnolls are also aware of how savage and intimidating they can appear to be, so many of them put quite a lot of effort into developing refined personal styles: fine clothing, subtle jewelry, neat cuts of hair and mane, and died fur are all common.
Gnolls also commonly use veils to hide their predator's jaws from those who they do not with to frighten or intimidate.</p>
<p>Not every Commonwealth Gnoll stays in the small town where they are born.
Many Gnollish families have a long military tradition, and Gnolls make up almost two-thirds of the Commonwealth military's ranks.</p>
<p>Since the first Gnollish manors were settled besides Halfling neighbors, the two races have cooperated closely; Gnolls have long found employment with Halfling trade-caravans as guards.
To this day, many Halfling communities are located next to Gnollish ones, and clans of Halflings and Gnolls may have traditions of cooperation that go back centuries.
Gnolls that travel with Halfling caravans are often more urbane than their cousins; they are also more likely to go to great lengths to perfect a personal style that is just intimidating enough to scare off the wrong sort, without disturbing the paying customers as well!</p>
<p>There are also a number of Gnollish tribal communities in the territory to the west of the Worldspine Mountains.
Notably, much like their symbiosis with Humans and Halflings in the east, several Gnollish tribes allied with Herder communities in the west, where the frail Herders greatly valued them for their physical strength; this alliance became a force to be reckoned with in the west, and was the major opponent to the Shade Elves prior to the coming of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>There is also a unique ethnic group of Gnolls hailing from stretch of snowy northland that lies to the east of the Worldspine mountains.
White-furred and adapted to the cold, these Gnolls have long lived on the snowy terrain above and around the subterranean holds of Dwarves, with whom they have long coexisted amicably; Snow Gnolls are expert hunters and herders, and they provide Dwarven holds with an invaluable source of meat.
Though few in numbers, the combination of these stealthy hunters scattered throughout the northern forests with the extreme resilience of Dwarven holds handily prevented the conquest of the North by the Empire of Man, and later by the Kingdoms of Men.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Kobolds are a relatively new addition to the Commonwealth; most
Kobold communities trace their origins to a mass exodus from the
Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture is very family-oriented, and very community-oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
families will cluster together to form a block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
families; because of this, they have grown explosively</p>
<ul>
<li>even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
metropolises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away – an
arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
tend to be highly productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look like tiny, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
warm-blooded.</li>
<li>Kobolds aren’t mammals; they don’t have mammary glands, and they
have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
different ideas about what constitutes “appropriate attire”.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
rare elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
other races.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
always have, and be left alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
they settle in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
species.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
among the communities that they settle in; “their own inclination”
is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate

<p><em>Hybrid</em>: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid. The specific
details of each form are fixed (that is, your Humanoid form (for
example) looks the same every time you shift to it; you can't
determine what your shape-shift forms look like each time you
shift). You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a

benefits. You gain the chosen benefits while in Hybrid form.</p>
<ul>
<li>Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.</li>
<li>Teeth: You have a predator’s jaw, which allows you to bite
foes. The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP. When you bite
someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose
to <em>latch on</em>; this normally works like grappling the
target.</li>
<li>Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on auditory
Perception checks.</li>
<li>Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in
addition to your other movement modes): Burrow 1 / 3, Climb
3 / 9, Flight 3 / 9 / 36, Glide 4 / 12 / 48, Hop 4 / 12,
Swim 3 / 9</li>
<li>Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent
sense.</li>
<li>Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you
gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this
environment. For example, you might choose to survive in
extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.</li>
<li>Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to
motion. You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving
targets.</li>
<li>Sprinter: choose one movement mode and increase it by +1/+3
(for example, Walking 4/12 would become Walking 5/15).</li>
<li>Thick Hide: You gain +1 armor.</li>

<li>
<p>Tags: Supernatural, Shape-Shifter, Amorphous, Clay Men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Groups: CM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Amorphous</em>: Clay Men are amorphous, and can manipulate their shape
at will; they can stretch, narrow, ball up, flatten out, and so on.
They cannot produce fine features, or alter their texture or color
(other than to grip, as in <em>Pseudopods</em> below), and thus they cannot
mimic specific people or objects. However, they can slip through
small spaces, and they can be almost impossible to grapple or
restrain effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Vital Organs</em>: Clay Men do not have vital organs, and thus they
are not vulnerable to attacks or powers that rely on targeting weak
points or vital organs.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have Resistance to attacks with the Precision tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Face</em>: Clay Men have no particular “front” or facing, and they
have no discrete sensory organs – so they can perceive all around
themselves, including directly above and below themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pseudopods</em>: Clay Men can extend pseudopods. They can extend up to
four pseudopods, each up to a meter long. They can manifest one
fewer pseudopod to make on other pseudopod one meter longer (so they
could, for example, extrude one four-meter pseudopod, or two
two-meter pseudopods).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No Bones</em>: Lacking a skeletal structure, Clay Men cannot take
advantage of leverage; this severely reduces their ability to deploy
their strength. Their damage bonus when using melee weapons is 0.
This ability may have other consequences as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Envelop: Clay Men have a unique form of physical combat available to
them: simply enveloping (and then digesting) an enemy. Enveloping
works much like Grappling, except that a successfully enveloped
enemy takes 1d10÷2 DV per turn while enveloped (this damage has the
Chemical tag). Enveloped targets are normally held immobile, but, if
they succeed on a STR+SOM check, they can deal damage to the Clay
Man with any weapon they are holding (or any natural weapon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fast Healing</em>: Clay Men have Fast Healing 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Powered</em>: Clay Men have internal supernatural process that help to
keep them going. They need to breath (by exchanging oxygen through
their surface), but they can extract oxygen from water as well as
breathing air. They need to eat to grow, but they need little food
when not growing or repairing damage. They do not need to sleep.
They can be effected by disease, but are resistant to most diseases
that affect humanoids (they have Resistance to diseases). They do
not age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Color-Changing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can change the color of your “skin”. You can create shapes
down to the scale of a few centimeters, which allows you to
create large letters, or to camouflage yourself (providing you a
+20 to Stealth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional Trait: Rigging.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can produce an internal support structure made of cartilage.
You can produce and dissolve the “rigging” at will: creating it
is a Task Action with a six hour duration, and dissolving it is
Task Action with a three hour duration. The rigging allows you
to take advantage of internal leverage, and thus negates the No
Bones trait; it also increases your STR by 5. However, the
cartilage is fragile, and it exposes you to bits of tiny broken
cartilage tumbling through you when you are injured; it reduces
your DUR by 5.</li>

A few adventurous Commonwealth dwarves travelled west with the Commonwealth, where they have dug holds in the Haven Isles, besides Ash Elves and Kobolds, and prospered.</p>
<h4 id="TraditionalDwarvenCulture"><a class="header-link" href="#TraditionalDwarvenCulture">Traditional Dwarven Culture</a></h4>
<p>Dwarves originate in the frozen north, where the low peaks and rolling foothills of the Worldspine Mountains give way to the coast, the ocean, and the forested plains to their east and west.
Dwarves have long been comfortable living underground, surrounded by growing things: many of their ancient communities consisted of small numbers of bermed buildings in the relative flatlands of the northeast, or of structures dug into the foothills of the Worldspine—many small Dwarven communities built on the surface still consist largely of bermed buildings.
As Dwarves began to urbanize, their earthen construction became larger and deeper; the development of sophisticated mining and masonry techniques allowed them to incorporate stone into their construction and to build underground, eventually producing the Dwarven clan-holds that were common when the Empire of Man first contacted them.</p>
<p>Most modern Dwarven holds are large, wide, sturdy structures built of stone and earthwork; they are often dug shallowly, with substantial extent on the surface (as opposed to deeper-digging races like Kobolds, who often build entirely subterranean structures deep underground).
Dwarven Holds are often built in a ring around the base of a hill; more rarely, they may be dug into open ground, or partially dug into the slope of a mountain.
They often feature large open spaces on the interior, which provide ventilation, and serve as public spaces or gardens.</p>
<p>The old Dwarven culture of the North is centered around kin and custom.
Most Dwarven holds will be controlled by a Clan, consisting of several families—though some large holds may be governed by several Clans, and some large and wealth Clans control multiple holds.
Rather than law and governance as such, holds tend to be run by custom and consensus; authority is typically held by the heads of families.
Similarly, exchange is more often mediated by custom than currency, and there is a strong emphasis on caring for kin.</p>
<p>Dwarves are open enough and are rarely hostile, although they can be insular; it can be extremely difficult for an outsider to find a place in such a family-oriented society.
For this reason, only about a third of the Dwarven Clans of the north ever signed the Commonwealth Charter; the others have remained independent.</p>
<p>Dwarves have cultivated expertise in mining, stonework and agriculture.
Craftsmen also hold high status in Dwarven holds, and many Dwarven communities are known for the quality of the work of their artisans, which can rival the work of Human craftsmen.</p>
<h4 id="HavenIslesDwarves"><a class="header-link" href="#HavenIslesDwarves">Haven Isles Dwarves</a></h4>
<p>Though only a few Dwarves chose to leave their northern lands and settle elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the communities founded by these travellers, explorers and exiles have endured, grown and prospered.
Today, Dwarves are one of the most common races in the huge urban centers of the Haven Isles in particular, where their own culture blends with their Kobold and Ash-Elf neighbors.</p>
<p>The Dwarves of the Haven Isles tend to be more mercantile; formal law and finance have substantially replaced tradition and custom in these communities.
Though some view this as a loss, it has made these communities far more open and accessible to outsiders; the Dwarves of the Haven Isles welcome guests, travelers and traders.</p>
<p>The Dwarves of the Haven Isles tend to get along particularly well with their Kobold neighbors, whose boisterous, zealous and optimistic nature are often welcome; these friendships can often be bittersweet, as Dwarves live much longer lives than Kobolds.
It is not unusual for one Dwarf to have a close and vital friendship with several generations of a Kobold family.</p>
<p>While many of these Dwarven populations reside in Holds dug into the peaks of the Haven Isles beside Ash Elves and Kobolds, several Dwarven clans have settled in the trading-cities and harbors of the Haven Isles' coast.
These &quot;shipwright&quot; Dwarves have come to cooperate closely with the Ratfolk, Halfling and Orcish shipwrights who have helped to build the Commonwealth's navy.</p>
<h4 id="MindsharingDwarves"><a class="header-link" href="#MindsharingDwarves">Mindsharing Dwarves</a></h4>
<p>In CY 509, Dwarven explorers discovered a strange, psionically active fungus beneath the low peak of a small island in the northern Haven Isles.
The fungus proved to have remarkable capabilities, and an entirely new Dwarven culture has developed around it.
This organism is called &quot;Fahra&quot; in Hud, which is derived from &quot;Fehr,&quot; or fungus; Clans that have accepted the organism as a symbiot are called Fahrat Clans.
The Common word for the organism is &quot;Mindshare Fungus,&quot; which is an apt description of what it does.</p>
<p>Mindshare Fungus can thrive on its own in the damp dark of caves beneath the Emerald Plane as well as any other fungus can, but it also has the ability to derive nourishment from the magical energies of living creatures—what is commonly called psionic energy.
What's more, the fungus can actually colonize the bodies of some other creatures—including Dwarves, whose physiology is highly compatible with it.
Mindshare Fungus is not a parasite, however, but rather a symbiote; it does not harm its hosts, but it does provide them with some remarkable benefits.
The Mindsharing Fungus can &quot;bridge&quot; the minds of its hosts; this allows those hosts to exchange thoughts, experiences, knowledge, and even skills.
These exchanges are largely voluntary; hosts have a great deal of control over what they share with others and what they take in—although they cannot completely shut out the connection.</p>
<p>Normally, this effect only works over short distances—hosts need to be within a few <em>strides</em> of each-other to bridge their minds.
However, the effect can be &quot;conducted&quot; over greater distance by Mindsharing Fungus &quot;plants&quot; themselves—and these &quot;plants&quot; can be quite large, with many different surface growths connected by a vast rootwork.
Mindshare &quot;plants&quot; also have the remarkable ability to <em>store</em> and <em>retrieve</em> parts of the minds of users—ranging from simple messages or discrete memories to fragments of personalities.</p>
<p>A unique, highly communal culture has sprung up around the <em>Fahra</em>.
The Mindsharing Dwarves tend to be radically open, honest and egalitarian.
Even more than traditional Dwarves, they run their societies by consensus and memory—thanks to the Mindsharing Fungus, they have little need of courts, contracts, physical records, or even schools.
Members of Mindsharing communities will often share some personality traits—an individual's personality is never forcefully changed, as even Mindsharing Dwarves value their individuality, but rather occurs naturally and inevitably as the mind of each member slightly overlaps with every other in a community.
Some communities remain highly individualistic in their own way, where each member lives their own lives and pursues their own goals, merely using the <em>Fahra</em> to best live at peace with their neighbors; in other communities, however, members can begin to &quot;vanish&quot; into the collective.</p>
<p>No Mindsharing community has been known to forcefully recruit a member, or force its will on a member; this is due in part to their culture, in part to Commonwealth law, and in part to the fact that the trauma and misery inflicted on that individual would &quot;leak&quot; over the link—no matter how much they might try to stop it—and would &quot;poison&quot; all the other members.
Still, there are those that fear them.</p>
<p>Most Mindsharing Dwarves live in the Haven Isles.
A few have resettled in their traditional homeland, building a few Holds in the northeast of the Worldspine mountains; their distant kin have greeted them cooly (an understatement in the case of the Deep-Explorer Dwarves).</p>
<h4 id="DeepExplorerDwarves"><a class="header-link" href="#DeepExplorerDwarves">Deep-Explorer Dwarves</a></h4>
<p>Deep-Explorer Dwarves are a Dwarven subculture that has vanished into the depths, substantially withdrawing from the affairs of surface-dwellers and &quot;shallow diggers&quot;.
The Deep-Explorer Dwarves' origins lie in the <em>Lun</em>, a confederation of Dwarven holds in the northeastern peaks of the Worldspine mountains.
Independent and individualistic, they where not among the holds that joined the Commonwealth.
In CY 514, a community of Dwarves from the Haven Isles settled in an abandoned Hold near the territory of the <em>Lun</em>; these Dwarves had brought the <em>Fahra</em> with them, and began to culture and experiment with the symbiotic organism.</p>
<p>The fiercely individualistic <em>Lun</em> where horrified; they feared what their new neighbors might become, and were particularly alarmed that their hold was in a position to close off the <em>Lun</em>'s path out of the Worldspine Mountains.
The <em>Lun</em> sought a refuge that the <em>Fahrat</em> could never breach, and a path of escape that they could never cut off; they began digging deeper underground in CY 517, and by CY 533 they had almost entirely withdrawn from the surface—their former settlements where now little more than heavily-fortified trading-posts.</p>
<p>Today, little is known about the Deep-Explorer Dwarves—called the <em>Drahrat</em> in their own language, a deliberate dig at the <em>Fahrat</em>.</p>

<p>Some Dwarves eyesight has become extremely sensitive; this allows them very good vision in dim light, but it also makes them very sensitive to bright light.
This is extremely common among the <em>Drahrat</em>, most of whom cannot venture in daylight without day-masks (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li>You gain the <em>Low-Light</em> sense.</li>
<li>You become highly sensitive to bright light; your are dazzled in bright light (such as daylight), suffering a -30 penalty to visual perception tests.</li>
<li>Prolonged exposure to bright light is increasingly painful, eventually causing permanent damage to your vision.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="CulturalItemDayMaskCostMediumorCostHight"><a class="header-link" href="#CulturalItemDayMaskCostMediumorCostHight">Cultural Item: Day-Mask (Cost: Medium or Cost: Hight)</a></h4>
<p>The <em>Day-Mask</em> consists of smoked lenses designed to filter out bright light, as well as a fabric or leather wrap that attaches them to the head.
The wrap is used to completely enclose the eyes, preventing light from &quot;leaking&quot; around the edges of the lenses; leather and wool are common in the north, while lighter fabrics (often dyed dark colors) are used in the south.</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not suffer any penalty from exposure to bright light (such as from the Cave-Eyes trait).</li>
<li>You suffer a -10 penalty to visual perception checks.</li>
<li>You suffer a -10 penalty in dim light.</li>
<li>Normal Day-Masks are Cost: Medium</li>
</ul>
<p>The lenses of some Day-Masks are <em>ground</em>, with different sections having different shapes.
This may be done to correct for poor vision, or may provide magnification at long or short range.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ground</em> Day-Masks provide a +10 bonus to visual perception checks.</li>
<li><em>Grinding</em> a Day-Mask is Cost: Medium (in addition to the cost of the Day Mask).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Day-Masks are magical; their lenses are crystal-clear in dim light, but rapidly &quot;smoke over&quot; when exposed to bright light.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magical Day-Masks protect your eyes from bright light the way normal Day-Masks do, but they impose none of the penalties that normal Day-Masks have.</li>
<li>The lenses &quot;smoke over&quot; in little more than a second.  If you are suddenly exposed to bright light, you may experience some dazzling (incuring a -10 penalty to visual perception tests), but this fades quickly (lasting only for the first turn of exposure).</li>
<li>You can force the Day-Mask to become clear or smoked.</li>
<li>Magical Day-Masks are usually <em>ground</em> (at no additional cost).</li>
<li>Magical Day-Masks are Cost: High.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="CulturalItemDayWrap"><a class="header-link" href="#CulturalItemDayWrap">Cultural Item: Day-Wrap</a></h4>
<p>Dwarves who cannot afford a Day-Mask—or who must do without one for some other reason—often use a <em>wrap</em> like a large bandanna; there are different ways to wear the <em>day-wrap</em>, but it is usually worn so that it shades the face and eyes.
[Dwarven day-wraps are much like <em>shemaghs</em>.]</p>
<p>Some day-wraps may be woven in complex patterns or richly died; many Clans and Holds have specific patterns and colors.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wearing a day-wrap—or improvising a similar covering—the penalty for exposure to bright light is reduced to -20.</li>
<li>Day-wraps work by shading the eyes from the sun; they are ineffective against lights at eye-level.</li>
<li>Day-Wraps are Cost: Trivial</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="OptionalTraitMindSharing"><a class="header-link" href="#OptionalTraitMindSharing">Optional Trait: Mind-Sharing</a></h4>
<p>You have a <em>Fahra</em> symbiote; this allows you to share parts of your mind with other Mind-Sharing Dwarves nearby, and for them to share their minds with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>share your mind</em> with anyone else with the Mind-Sharing trait who is within 15m.
<ul>
<li>The Mind-Sharing Fungus serves as something of a conductor; if a Mind-Sharing Fungus is within range, then you can <em>share your mind</em> with anyone else with the Mind-Sharing trait who is within range of the same <em>Mind-Sharing Fungus</em>.</li>
<li>Note that many funguses are quite large; what may appear to be many different growths on the surface may actually all be parts of one huge plant, with a vast root-system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Sharing your mind</em> provides several benefits:
<ul>
<li>you can communicate, as though speaking;</li>
<li>you can share a sense-perception (i.e. allowing someone to see through your eyes);</li>
<li>you can share memories (i.e. allowing someone to perceive your memories as you do);</li>
<li>you can share knowledge;</li>
<li>you can share your skills (if you have 30 or more ranks in a skill, then you can grant someone access to your skill; they are treated as if they have 15 ranks in that skill);</li>
<li>you can even &quot;fortify&quot; someone else's mind (if you have a rating of 25 or more in an aptitude, then you can &quot;fortify&quot; that aptitude in someone else; they are treated as having a rating of 15 in that aptitude).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being connected with the minds of others can cause some of your personality to blend with their, and vice-versa.
<ul>
<li>This effect is subtle, only occurs over the long-term, and is intended to be role-played; even in its most extreme form, it does not <em>require</em> a character to &quot;loose themselves&quot; to those they are sharing their mind with.</li>

<p>Halflings have a somewhat unique dimorphic society; the young and

while children, the infirm and the elderly live in fixed
settlements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halfling communities tend to form close, symbiotic relationships
with Gnollish villages and families. Halfling communities are
frequently built near Gnollish towns and villages; they depend on
the Gnolls for security and labor, and the Gnolls depend on the
Halfling caravans to sell their produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, Gnolls commonly travel with Halfling caravans,
providing security—and services like smithing, for which Halflings
are poorly suited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caravans of Halfling traders and Gnollish guards knitted together

</li>
<li>
<p>Halflings have not grown at the rate that the other races have
grown, and other forms of trade—notably mediated by ships sailing
along major rivers, and along the coasts—have eclipsed the Caravans

<li>They were a tribal society: extended Families allied into Clans,
and several Clans might cooperate to found a city.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were a warlike honor-society</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcs are large and have poor reflexes; they made poor riders,
and so they marched to war on foot. Because of this, and their
fractious nature, they rarely mustered large armies and marched
to war.</li>
<li>They had ample access to sea and river; their clans built many
small, shallow-draft long-boats, and they were terrifying
raiders up and down the nearby coasts.</li>
<li>Threat of invasion, and promise of relief from raiding, were
used to force other nearby societies to pay tribute; Orcs
typically raided distant seaport cities, and the clans often
warred among themselves.</li>
<li>For conflicts within their society, they used a system of
ritualized combat.</li>
<li>The period before contact with the Commonwealth represents a
golden age for the orcs, a period of wealth and power—and a time
of misery for their neighbors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans of the Old Empire avoided Orcish lands, using their
tributaries as a buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centuries later, in CY 91, the Commonwealth began to spread west of
the World-Spine, incorporating former Imperial human settlements and
tribes (when willing) alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>In CY 113, the Commonwealth allowed a tribe of Elves who the
Orcs had claimed as tributaries to join; thereafter, the Elves
stopped paying tribute, and the orcs sacked them.</li>
<li>This led the Commonwealth to lay siege to the Orcish clan-hold
that launched the attack.</li>
<li>Other Orcish cities marshaled an army and attempted to break the
siege; their attempt failed.</li>
<li>This led to 20 years of warfare between the Commonwealth; the
Orcs were significantly outmatched by the Commonwealth military,
and most of their tributaries were liberated. By CY 131, they
were left with no tributaries, and were surrounded by
Commonwealth settlements and Commonwealth-allied tribes.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth also began to fortify the coast and
river-front; though expensive for the Commonwealth to construct,
this effectively prevented Orc raiding, as their small and
mobile raiding parties could not carry the means to break
fortifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There followed a time of misery; without the tribute they depended
on and unable to profitably raid, their society fell into decline.</p>
<ul>
<li>They were riven by internal conflict, as individuals, families
and clans battled over what wealth and power remained.</li>
<li>The Orcish population underwent a contraction, and their cities
and roads suffered great neglect and decay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generation or Orcs grew up in misery, look out at the prosperous
Commonwealth. Some went to explore it; on returning, they carried
back stories of a prosperous, diverse society.</p>
<ul>
<li>In CY 154, the orc Odna returned from exploring the
Commonwealth, and began to advocate for a radical course:
joining the Commonwealth and subscribing to their laws.</li>
<li>In CY 155, he challenged first his own clan head, and then a
champion of the clans of his city; he won both challenges, and
on behalf of his city and its clans, signed the Commonwealth
Charter; thus did the city of Akala become the first Orcish city
to join the Commonwealth.</li>
<li>Access to the Commonwealth’s markets greatly eased the misery of
Akala; seeing their success, other movements in other clan-holds
also sought to join the Commonwealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, Orcs have been members of the Commonwealth for almost 700
years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcish culture struggled to adapt itself to Commonwealth law and
tradition: today, it is a blend of traditional Orcish elements,
imports from the rest of the Commonwealth and uniquely Orcish
innovations.</li>
<li>Their views on the Commonwealth and their place within it are
complex. Though they take pride in being members of an ascendant
and prosperous people, they also remember how they came to be
members in it—the most traditional among their numbers claim
that they were conquered, and that they still bear the shame of
it.</li>
<li>Honor continues to be highly valued in Orcish society. Though
most have taken the view that great works and labors are
achievements worthy of honor and glory, the most traditional
still believe that victory in combat is the greatest honor.</li>
<li>Though some orcs remain within their ancient borders and
practice a (modified) version of their traditions, others travel
the wider world seeking honor and accomplishment (and to bring
wealth home, since Orcish communities still do not have adequate
farming).</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, many Orcs seek honor and recognition in the
Commonwealth military. Orcs are very strong, and so many seek
work as laborers and artisans—notably, Orcish cities boast
impressive architecture. Orcs are also very clever, and some
seek honor and achievement in the Commonwealth’s universities
(Orcish scholars are generally not known for being nurturing and
understanding mentors).</li>
<li>Notably, many Elvish communities exist near Orcish ones. Most
orcs and elves have good relations, as they are both tribal
cultures and have long lived near each other—for most, their
time of conflict is centuries past and forgotten. Still, a few
of the most traditional—in both communities—continue to nurse
ancient grudges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Orcish people can claim 6 major cities: five are their
traditional cities, and the sixth was established on the
Commonwealth’s border with the Shade Elves. Of the orcs five
traditional cities, three are members of the Commonwealth, and the
remaining two are not.</p>
<ul>
<li>When dealing with each other, orcs use their ancient customs,
and orcs come and go between the Commonwealth and independent
cities freely.</li>
<li>As a historical note, the city of Tonilac changed hands once: it
was claimed by honorable combat by independent orcs, before
being reclaimed by the Commonwealth six years later.</li>
<li>The city of Collac is a Commonwealth-member that was built on
the border with the Shade Elves; it is heavily fortified, and
the orcs there skirmish constantly with the Shade Elves, their
allies, and their subjugate peoples.</li>
<li>Notably, the island city-state of Kethal is heavily settled by
Orcs; in times past, it was shared amicably by Orcs and Dwarves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orcs have a vibrant mythos and rich oral history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orcs have several mythical heroes, about whom a great many
stories have been told.</li>
<li>A particularly common point in Orcish Myth, which many
historians believe corresponds to an actual event, is the Great
Plague, an event some 15 generations ago that devastated many
Orcish communities. The Great Pleague is frequently used a
setting for heroic adventures of Orcish myth.</li>
<li>Over the last few hundred years, Orcs have actively transcribed
many of these stories; their large libraries filled with
beautifully-illuminated books are points of pride for their
community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orcs are roughly humanoid. They are tall, lean and muscular. Their
skin is typically either green, brown, or red; most clans will have
one skin tone that is more common among them. Orcs also have
prominent tusks.</p>

<h3 id="Ratfolk"><a class="header-link" href="#Ratfolk">Ratfolk</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 500 years ago, there was one Ratfolk civilization in the
Warren Isles, an island chain off the Southwest near the Haven
Isles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were organized into warrens run by families, and practiced
fishing and farming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 331, 20 years before the Commonwealth started to settle Islandhome, several wealthy Ratfolk warrens united and forced their neighboring to pay tribute; they became wealthy and powerful while their kin suffored.  In the following years, other Ratfolk warlords began to rise in the Warren Isles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 361, the Shade Elves crossed the Shaded Sea and began to heavily raid the Warren Isles.</p>
<ul>
<li>large numbers of Ratfolk begin fleeing the Warren Isles.</li>
<li>Some travel north to the Haven Isles, where they were eventually incorporated into the Commonwealth;</li>
<li>others fled South to the Ruby Plane, where they encountered the Raptors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In CY 395, the conflict between the Warren Isles Ratfolk and the Shade Elves drags to a halt; in 398, the two form a tentative alliance, creating the Shaded Sea Peoples.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is later learned that the &quot;alliance&quot; was a construct of the enigmatic Leapers.</li>
<li>The Leapers had attacked the major cities of Shade Elves and the largest warrens in the Haven Isles, and had forced both the Shade Elves and Ratfolk to pay them tribute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are now 3 distinct Ratfolk cultures:</p>
<ul>
<li>they have a large population in the Commonwealth, first in the
Haven Isles and now spreading throughout Heartland;</li>
<li>they are one of the two founders of the Raptor’s Alliance,
formed with the raptors to repel Shaded Sea Peoples, including
their “cousins”;</li>
<li>the Shaded Sea Peoples, a society consisting of Ratfolk and
Shade Elf families.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural traders and merchants; in the Commonwealth, Ratfolk tend to
get along well with Halflings and Humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As scavengers, they also get along well with Gnolls; Ratfolk are one
of the few species that can eat the same food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratfolk are one of the Commonwealth’s subterranean cultures; they
often dwell in underground burrows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though Ratfolk do maintain their own culture and tradition, they
were heavily assimilated into the established Commonwealth culture
that sheltered them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are comfortable in urban environments and often live beside
other races and cultures. They are comfortable above-ground and
underground, and often work as traders and artisans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniquely Ratfolk settlements are often organized around warrens;
similar to Dwarven holds, they are mixed above-ground and
subterranean structures. They still maintain fishing and seafaring
traditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They commonly speak Haven Isles Ratfolk (language group GR).</p>

<p>Shamblers are spirits bound to plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They originated in the dense marshes of the Southern lowlands to the
West of the World-Spine Mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were created when Father Cypress, a Great Spirit who admired
mortals and wished to interact with them, created plants with
internal processes that could support Spirits, and fashioned of
himself Spirits who could dwell within them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owing to their ability to root, Shambler communities lack cleared
fields and grazing-lands—they also tend to have an active night

isolated, deep swamps, Shamblers can be surprisingly urbane; they

<p><em>Appearance of Flesh</em>: Even though Tempters are spirits, they are bound to the nature of flesh;they have a physical form, they can be wounded and killed, they can sicken, and they need to eat, drink, breath and sleep just like mortal beings.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, because they are so bound to the nature of flesh, they are not immediately obvious as spirits to those with Mage Sight.  In order for someone with Mage Sight to recognize a Tempter, a detailed examination is required; this is a 10 minute Task Action, requiring either a Search or Spellcraft check at -20.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Shape-Shifting</em>: Tempters can take the form of any medium-sized natural creature. They can control the details of their physical form as they wish, including being able to mimic specific individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They must take the form of a <em>real</em> (in the worlf of Renaissance) creature; they can't assume the shape of any arbitrary thing they could imagine.  That is, they can, for example, appear to be a Human, a Gnoll, a Drake and so on, but they cannot appear to be a ball of arms, legs and claws.</li>
<li>They can change shape as a Standard Action.</li>
<li>They can control their shape precisely enough that they can appear to be a specific person.
<ul>
<li>Assuming the form of a <em>specific</em> individual requires a Disguise check at +10.</li>
<li>To competently impersonate a person whose shape they have assumed, they will still need to use the Disguise and Deception skills, but they receive a +30 and +10 bonus on these checks, respectively.</li>
<li>Obviously, they can only mimic the features of a person that they know about.  If someone has a birthmark on their lower back, but the Shifter character has never seen that person naked, then they won't know to mimic that birthmark.  And, of course, if they've never seen a person, they cannot effectively mimic them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normally, changing shape does not affect their statistics—but see the powers listed below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mimics</em>: Tempters can also mimic the <em>speech</em> of any race whose shape they can take, and can mimic the voice of specific individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Much like mimicing an individual's appearance, they still need to know what that person sounds like, and they will still need to use Disguise and Deception checks to actually impersonate someone.</li>

<ul>
<li>This sense has a limited range—roughly 10 meters, although you may be able to read intense emotion from further away.</li>
<li>Manipulating other's emotions is a 5 Turn Task Action; it requires either a Control Check or a SAV+WIL+WIL check, and is opposed by the target's INT+WIL.  If you use your SAV+WIL+WIL then exceptional and critical successes are ignored.</li>

<li>The origins of the Shifters are lost to history; perhaps obviously, they have been influenced by far more exotic forces than merely having a mix of elven and human blood.  (As such, Shifters are usually regarded as a separate race, and have their own entry.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“First generation” elf-human hybrids often have no culture of their own; they are often born into an elven or human culture somewhere in the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially in Westward Province, Commonwealth cities and towns often develop a shared local culture with Wood Elven tribes near them.  In these areas, hybrids are a familiar site—if not precisely common, since they usually cannot reproduce themselves.</li>

<h3 id="Gremlins"><a class="header-link" href="#Gremlins">Gremlins</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These small creatures resemble hairless cats in gross appearance, save that they have hands rather than paws, walk upright, and are not <em>much</em> larger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their homelands where conquered by Goblin kings and warlords long ago, and they have been subjects of the Goblins for centuries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Though the Goblins Code does declare that all other species are inferior to Goblins and are worthy of enslavement, it does grant some species special status over others; Gremlins are one such species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins are eligible for &quot;favored servant&quot; status; though they are still subordinate to Goblins, Gremlins that have earned this status are afforded preferential treatment and special privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that have earned this status often serve as faithful retainers, performing tasks that, though they are beneath the dignity of a proper Goblin, still require trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins also often serve as soldiers or mercenaries; Gremlins may keep a rabble of lesser slaves in line, or may guard the vulnerable flanks of the Goblin's highly effective long-spear formations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favored Servant status is often passed down family lines by Gremlins, with parents grooming their offspring to continue in the service of a Goblin King, noble, warlord or family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favored servants often mark their status with tattoos, which might symbolize their lineage, the Goblin line they serve, or their deeds.</p>

<li>
<p>Gremlins are more likely than Goblins to flee the Goblin Empire and settle within the Commonwealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that <em>do not</em> have &quot;favored servant&quot; status are <em>especially</em> likely to attempt to flee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gremlins that <em>were</em> favored servants are likely to receive a cold reception in the Commonwealth, especially among the small communities of Goblins and Gremlins that have settled in free lands, since other Goblin and Gremlin communities in the Commonwealth are likely to view them as traitors, collaborators and thugs.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>They have powerful legs and nasty claws, and are natural climbers
and leapers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, they were a society of tribal hunters: the
young and old lived in settlements, while the healthy ranged and
hunted in the thick jungles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact with the Ratfolk brought them access to worked iron and
bronze, and the two collaborated to adapt Ratfolk farming techniques
to the deep jungle; these have helped revolutionize Raptor culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though many of them are still hunters, they have expanded the scale
of their agriculture significantly, and trade with Ratfolk burrows
for finished weapons and tools.</p>

<h3 id="Washers"><a class="header-link" href="#Washers">Washers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The name “washers” was taken from observations of the species by early Commonwealth explorers; “Jerks” is a fair (if polite) translation of the name they have for themselves.</li>
<li>Washers are small, furry, and semi-humanoid in gross layout.
<ul>
<li>They are covered in dull, grey-brown fur, with a distinctive black “eye-mask” pattern on their faces and black rings around their bushy tails.</li>
<li>Washers move more naturally on all fours than they do upright; their arms and legs are unusually short and oddly-proportioned by humanoid standards.</li>
<li>Washers have extremely dexterous hands and feet, and they are very strong climbers.</li>
<li>Washers have an extraordinary sense of touch in their hands—so keen that they can better perceive a small object by feeling it than by looking at it.  Members of other races may find it cute when Washers frenetically paw small objects to examine them—and more than a little unnerving when they manipulate fine objects without looking at them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Washers lived in a region in the east of the Raptor’s Plane, in the forests that bordered on the sandy, arid northeastern peninsula.
<ul>
<li>Tragically, that sandy, arid northeastern peninsula was the region first conquered by the Goblinoid Kings (and now ruled by the Goblin Empire).</li>
<li>Not long after discovering them, the Goblins attempted to make slaves of the Washers, highly valuing their tiny, dexterous hands; they quickly decided that the Washers’ temperament made them unsuitable for enslavement, and moved instead to eradicate them.</li>
<li>Too late did the Washers ally themselves with the Raptors and join their alliance with the Ratfolk; by this time, they only had one major city left, and a total surviving population of just more than a quarter-million.</li>
<li>Today, the Washer’s territory defines the border between the Raptor’s Alliance and the Goblinoid territories.</li>

<h3 id="Brightfeathers"><a class="header-link" href="#Brightfeathers">Brightfeathers</a></h3>
<p>Brightfeathers are small, bird-like humanoids with a wide variety of richly colored plumages. Once the sole inhabitants of the western fringe of the Ruby Plane, they were formerly a relatively isolated culture until Ratfolk began fleeing the Warren Isles to avoid the brunt of Shade Elven raids and quickly began to establish themselves in their new home. The Ratfolk brought relatively advanced technology to the Brightfeathers, who gained the ability to sail along the coastal waters rather than attempting to traverse the dense jungles on foot or wing. While this helped open them to others on the Plane, this also made them natural allies for the Ratfolk as they established themselves.</p>
<p>Initially, they were mistrusted along with the Ratfolk who had fled the Warren Isles due to their connection wth the brutal raids from the Shaded Sea Peoples, but in time the other major power in the northwestern Ruby Plane, the Raptors,came to view coexistance as essential to survival against the onslaught from the north, leading to the initial treaties which later lead to the official establishment of the Raptor Protectorate.</p>
<p>The Brightfeathers themselves have a rich culture, with a native language which cannot be imitated by any other known race and a complex psuedo-pictographic writing system. Until meeting the Ratfolk, their existance had long been rather peaceful, which helps to explain their particular focus on art of almost any kind. Creative expression is very important to them, and those who create great works are highly respected.</p>
<p>Their language, Songspeak, is based largely on mimicry, with many words simply consisting of an imitation of the sound of their meaning. Additionally, much of their cultural traditions center around music and singing, with much of their history conveyed and many of their observances celebrated through song. In the past, these songs were entirely of their own creation, but in the modern era, many Brightfeathers are fascinated with the music and languages of other cultures, leading many to seek to travel as extensively as possible to experience as many new sounds as they can.</p>

<h3 id="BoneSpiders"><a class="header-link" href="#BoneSpiders">Bone Spiders</a></h3>
<p>Bone Spiders are among the more unique races to set foot on the Emerald Plane.</p>
<p>Bone Spiders are arranged somewhat like crabs or spiders, but much larger; they have a large central section about a meter across, from which six meter-long legs extend.
They have a head section at one end; it is not articulated with a neck, but continuous with the body.
Two arms extend from the front, from slightly below the head, one on either side of it.
They have multiple eyes—two large ones on the head facing forward, and four smaller pairs situated around the head; this arrangement gives them more than 180 degrees of vision, and allows them to see above and below them.
Bone Spiders have large bone plates covering their backs, underbellies and limbs.
There are a half-dozen diamond-shaped plates on their back, which overlap at their edges a little like scale mail; the plates on their underbellies are segmented, arranged in strips.
Bone Spiders are semi-aquatic; they have gills on their underbellies, and can breathe underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers.
Bone Spiders are omnivorous.</p>
<p>Bone Spiders only recently made contact with the Commonwealth.
Bone Spider explorers first discovered the Emerald Plane and the Commonwealth some twenty years ago; a trickle of Bone Spider merchants have followed.</p>
<p>Bone Spiders are from a lone island some two months’ voyage from the eastern coast of the Emerald Plane.
Their island is not large: it is roughly circular, and it would take less than two weeks to cross it on food at its widest.
The island is rocky and mountainous, rising to a single low peak in its middle.
Along its northern and southern coasts, the rocks descend directly into the sea; besides a few lagoons, there is little arable land.
Along the eastern and western coasts, there are flat stretches, hosting thin bands of soil and greenery between the sandy shores and the rocky slope.</p>
<p>The Bone Spiders earliest culture began in a system of flooded caves and caverns in the center of their island.
Among their earliest myths are the stories of ascending from the deep caves to surface, and then descending form the slopes of the mountain to discover the thin crescents of fertile ground on their eastern and western coasts.
Bone Spiders have long practiced aquaculture in the shallows around their island, and have a long history of boat-building and sailing.
Only within the last hundred years did Bone Spiders begin to develop the kinds of boats that could cross the open ocean.</p>
<p>The total Bone Spider population is not large; they have largely filled in the habitable portions of their island and the shallows around it, though they number fewer than five hundred thousand.
Despite this fact, they seem in little hurry to expand onto the Emerald Plane.
They do seem eager to trade, however, and a steady trickle of Bone-Spider merchant-ships have docked at ports along the eastern and southern coasts of the Emerald Plane.</p>
<p>Those traders who do encounter these rare creatures should be advised: Bone Spiders find attempts to mimic their culture to be <em>very</em> tiresome.</p>
<p>Bone Spiders produce several varieties of beer, wine and liquor from the plants they grow in aquaculture; these exotic spirits fetch a high price in the Commonwealth's market.
Merchants who deal with them know that Bone Spiders will not actually drink the spirits that they sell; nor do they mistake the wax-paper containers the wine is stored in as a sign of quality.</p>
