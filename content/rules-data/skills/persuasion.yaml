description: |
    Persuasion is used when attempting to convince a character to go
    along with something.

    For minor dealings with an NPC, usually used unopposed. For
    important tests, or when an NPC is skeptical or requires
    convincing, oppose with a
    [Resist Social Manipulation](#Special-Numbers) check.

    For social negotiations, use opposed Persuasion
    (or [Protocol](#protocol-sav)) checks.
