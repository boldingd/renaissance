description: |
  Used to deceive people in social situations -- to make other
  characters believe what you want them to believe.

  Can also be used (probably in conjunction with Disguise) to hide
  your identity, and possibly to impersonate someone else.
  (Obviously, impersonating a specific person will be very tricky,
  and might not be possible at all if you don't have information
  about that person to go on, or are forced to interact with
  people who know that person well.)

  For minor or simple lies, can be used unopposed. For big lies,
  important scenes or major characters, your Deception is opposed
  by either the target's [Read](#Read) or their [Resist Social
  Manipulation](#Special-Numbers).
specializations: Lying, Negotiation, Impersonation.
