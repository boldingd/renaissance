description: |
  Knowledge represents, well, knowledge in some area of interest for your
  character.

  Almost anything can be a Knowledge field. When selecting a
  field, be careful: it shouldn't be so narrow that it never
  applies, but it also shouldn't be so broad that it _always_
  applies.
fields: |
  By interest, such as Criminal Gangs, Folklore, Local Religions,
  Military Tactics or Noble Lines, or by field of study such as
  Astronomy, History, Literature, Magic, Mathematics,
  Natural Philosophy, Philosophy, Rhetoric, or Theology.
specializations: Varies by field.
