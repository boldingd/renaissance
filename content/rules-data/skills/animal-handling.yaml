description: |
  Animal Handling is used as the "Social Skill for Animals". It's
  used to coax animals into behaving how you want.

  Animal Handling can be used to train an animal, but we don't
  provide detailed rules for that. This is generally best handled
  either by purchasing a Class or Power (like [Wildlander|class/wildlander]), or by
  purchasing the animal companion as a Moderate or Major Item and
  then building it using the rules for Followers.
specializations: |
  by a family of animals (canines, felines, equines, etc.), or by
  role (combat, work, companion, riding)
