description: |
  Disable Device represents your ability to defeat mechanical
  devices. It is used to pick locks, disable traps, and disable magical
  devices.

  It is usually used unapposed, although the quality of the device
  might impose a penalty (or allow a bonus).

    Maybe should be COG or COO, but hey, not enough COO skills.
