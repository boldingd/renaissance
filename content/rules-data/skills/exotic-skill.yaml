description: |
  Freeform skill, used to handle very unusual cases of other
  skills.

  Examples:
  -   Exotic Weapon (COO for ranged, SOM for melee)
  -   Exotic Culture (SAV, Protocol for very alien cultures)
  -   Exotic Knowledge (COG, for esoteric knowledge)
  -   Exotic Mount (COO or SAV)
  -   Exotic Movement (SOM or COO)

  Don't be too eager to resort to Exotic Skills! You are _almost
  always_ better served by using a normal skill, perhaps with a
  specialization to indicate your unique background or interest.
