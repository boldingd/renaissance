description: |
  Barter represents your ability to acquire things you need (or want)
  at a good price; used in the rules for _Acquiring Items_ (see
  [Items](/chapters/Items/)).

  Barter is specifically used for trading, which normally means
  when acquiring goods. Normally, negotiations (like legal bartering
  in a courtroom) are handled with [Protocol](#Protocol-SAV).

  ```aside
  It seems far more specific than these other skills, but it's
  useful because other mechanics us it. Still a little torn on
  this'n.
