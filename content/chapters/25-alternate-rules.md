title: "Alternate Rules"
---

The following are alternate rules systems. Some of them might be ideas
that I’m playing with for future inclusion, while others might just be
common systems that most people would house-rule in if we didn’t cover
them. Some are just good rules that we didn’t think fit in the core
rules, for one reason or another.

## Buying Back Negative Traits

  - Sometimes a player might want to remove a negative trait that
    they’ve acquired.
    
      - Maybe a negative trait they selected during character creation
        is turning out to be more of a hassle than they thought it
        would, or
      - maybe they acquired the trait during play and want to get rid of
        it (who wants to be Wanted forever?).

  - Using these rules, when a character is spending rez, they may spend
    an amount of Rez equal to the CP bonus from a negative trait to “buy
    it off”—that is, remove it.

  - Optionally, the GM can rule that some negative traits cannot simply
    be bought off, but might require some in-character action.
    
      - Buying back the Wanted trait, for example, might be an
        interesting adventure in itself.
      - Of course, when this happens, the GM should lower the cost in
        Rez to buy the trait off (potentially even all the way to 0).
        This essentially represents giving the character credit for the
        extra work that they’re doing.

## Creating Advantage

  - This alternate rule represents a system for using one skill to help
    out with another
    
      - it replaces the Related Skill and Assisting Characters bonuses.

  - Characters can attempt to create advantage for an upcoming check,
    called the Primary Check.

  - To create an advantage, a character picks a skill that could be used
    to help—usually a skill that could be a related skill, or that could
    be used to assist. They then roll a Simple Check: if they succeed,
    then the primary check has *advantage.*

  - If a character has advantage on a test, then they select on effect
    that they would normally spend a Luck Point for, and again that
    benefit.

  - A character can potentially create advantage for themselves, or for
    other characters.

  - For example, suppose you’d like to sit in a market and listen for
    local gossip, but you want to do so without attracting attention.
    This is naturally a Stealth test, since you’re trying to “blend in.”
    But, if you’re a social character, you might not have a good Stealth
    rating.
    
      - With the normal rules, you might ask the GM if you can use your
        Protocol as a related skill—representing you using your
        knowledge of social norms to be inconspicuous.

  - The test that you would like to create an advantage for is the
    *primary test*, and the skill that you would like to use to create
    that advantage is the *secondary skill*.

  - To create advantage, before making the primary test, make a Simple
    Success Check using the secondary skill; if you excel, you gain
    *advantage* on the primary test.

  - If you have *advantage* on a test, you may select one effect that
    you would normally spend a Luck Point for, and gain that benefit.
    (So you could choose to remove all negative modifiers, for example.)
    
      - You still have to follow the restrictions about when you can
        spend a luck point. For example, you can’t decide before you
        roll that you’d like to flip your result, and you can’t decide
        after you roll that you’d like to remove all negative modifiers.

  - Sometimes, creating advantage doesn’t require a discrete action; if
    you’re using your Academics: Alchemy to help you craft a potion,
    then the Academics: Alchemy secondary skill test isn’t a separate
    action from the Task Action to brew the potion.
    
      - Someteimes, however, you *can* create advantage as a separate
        action. If you research a noble’s family history in a library
        before attempting to arrange a meeting, then you can represent
        that by using a Research test (a Task Action) to create
        advantage on the following Protocol test.

## Fate Points

  - “Borrowed” from Fate.

  - We hate Fate, but hey, other people like it, so for them, there’s
    the Fate Points alternative rule.

  - This optional rule adds a new stat: similar to Luck Points,
    characters now have the Fate stat and Fate Points.

  - Each character also receives 1 Fate for free during character
    creation, and they can increase their Fate by 1 for 15 CP.

  - Like Luck, characters begin play with a number of Fate Points equal
    to their Fate stat; over the course of the game, they can gain,
    spend and lose Fate Points, but their Fate state remains the same.

  - Players may spend a Fate Point to do the following:
    
      - Specify some useful detail about their surroundings—like a
        window that they can jump through to escape Danger 5, or paint
        they can use to pretend they have clothes on.
      - Specify some connection they have to an NPC (such as that they
        served in the same regiment).
      - To avoid dying when reaching their DR (additional damage is
        discarded).

  - GMs may veto a use of a Fate Point if it is absurd, disruptive or
    completely implausible.

  - Any suggestions for rules for gaining and loosing Fate Points?

## Guns

Guns have little presence in the core rules: the Dragon's Ace and Hand-Cannon are the only two listed, and both are exotic weapons.
In CY 830, cannons exist, but are large and awkward, and are only used in siegecraft; man-portable guns also exist, represented by the hand-cannon, but are awkward and are only beginning to see deployment.

Still, there are types of firearms that, though perhaps decades or centuries from development and wide deployment, are not beyond the capabilities of the Commonwealth to manufacture—and, more importantly, blunderbusses and muskets have a long history in fantasy.
Guns more advanced than the hand-cannon can be included without too much disruption; some examples are given below.

Guns are handled using the Ranged Weapons skill, with the Guns proficiency.
Much like crossbows, guns must be reloaded after being fired;
guns are usually loaded by ramming black powder and a ball or canister down the barrel.
Also like crossbows—modern heavy crossbows in particular—reloading guns can be a time-consuming process.

### Shot and Gunpowder

Guns require both shot and gunpowder to fire.
Gunpowder is ruined if it gets wet, so it is usually stored in water-resistant containers.
Obviously, guns cannot be fired or loaded under water.

Normally, we don't track how much ammo you have for an ammo-consuming weapon; guns are a slightly special case.
We don't track how much "basic" ammo you have, but we *do* track how much gunpowder your character has.
This is because gunpowder is difficult to produce (compared to an arrow), because it is easily ruined (by moisture), and because gunpowder has significant secondary uses (it can be used as an explosive rather than fired, for example).

Enough gunpowder to fire 10 rounds is Cost: Low.

We track how much special ammo you have as normal.
Firing special ammo uses up gunpowder the same way firing basic ammo does.

### Gunsmithing

Just like any other item, guns, gunpowder, and ammo can be produced by players using the rules for crafting.
Guns and ammo can be produced using Craft: Smithing, and gunpowder can be produced with Craft: Alchemy.
Guns are difficult to produce, so they incur a -10 penalty; gunpowder, however, is not complex to produce, and so enjoys a +10 bonus.

Alternatively, when using these optional rules, *Gunsmithing* can be taken as a craft field; *gunsmithing* covers the production of guns, ammo, and gunpowder.
When producing a gun with Craft: Gunsmithing, you do not take the -10 penalty given above.

### Guns

#### Blunderbuss

Blunderbussses are two-handed, short-barreled weapons with fluted ends.
They aren’t particularly accurate and they don't have great range, but they are compact, easy to use and deadly at close-range.
They are usually used to fire (scatter)shot, although they can also be loaded with other projectiles as well.

Blunderbusses are called "thunder-javelins" in Common.

**Tags:** Easy, Loud, One-Handed, Prone, Ranged, Reload, Vulnerable

**Range:** 15m / 25m / 35m

**Reload:** 2 Standard Actions

**Ammo:**

- Ball: 2d10 DV, AP -6.  Cost: None (standard ammo)
- Scatter: 1d10+1 DV, AP -1, splash 3m.  Cost: None (standard ammo)
- Scour Canister: 3m splash, covers targets with Scour.  Cost: Moderate per 10

#### Dragon

The Dragon is the short, one-handed version of the Blunderbuss.
It uses lighter loads and smaller projectiles.

These weapons are called "thunder-darts" in Common.

**Tags:** Easy, Loud, One-Handed, Prone, Ranged, Reload, Vulnerable

**Range:** 10m / 20m / 30m

**Reload:** 2 Standard Actions

**Ammo:**

- Ball: 1d10+3 DV, AP -5.  Cost: None (standard ammo)
- Scatter: 1d10-1 DV, AP -1, splash 2m.  Cost: None (standard ammo)
- Scour Canister: 2m splash, covers targets with Scour.  Cost: Moderate per 10

#### Musket

A musket is a long-barrelled weapon that fires a lead ball from its smooth barrel.
Though large weapons, they are far superior to hand-cannons; their much longer barrels make them far more accurate, and their trigger and flintlock firing mechanism makes it much easier for one person to aim and fire them.
While their wounds are gruesome, they are even more notable for being very effective at penetrating armor.

**Tags:** Loud, One-Handed, Prone, Ranged, Reload, Vulnerable

**Damage:** 3d10+2 DV

**AP:** -9

**Range:** 30mm / 60m / 120m / 180m

**Reload:** 2 Standard Actions

#### Trio

This unusual, multi-barrelled weapon represents an attempt to overcome the low firing-rate of muzzle-loaded weapons.
It is essentially three steel barrels fixed to a wooden heft.
Despite its simple design, it's multiple barrels must be carefully crafted out of high-quality steel, in order to make sure that they are light enough for infantry to carry without being so thin that they are likely to rupture (especially as the weapon heats up).
The desire to save weight has also lead to a shortening of the barrel and a lightening of the projectile, which incurs other sacrifices.
The weapon also uses touch-holes to fire, rather than having a trigger mechanism; keeping track of each touch-hole on each of the three barrels can be slightly tricky, so the weapon is often rotated in hand after a barrel is discharged.
Also, like the hand-cannon, the trio is often operated by two soldiers, one who holds and aims the weapon, and another who lights the touch-holes.

Officially, the Trio is called the "three barrels" in Common; this is a reference to the Three Cities at the peak of Islandhome.
Informally, the Trio is often called the "Kobold's Dance," named for a dance common in Haven Isles Kobold communities that includes rapid clapping.
It is sometimes derisively referred to as the "bomb that you don't throw," after some early iron prototypes suffered catastrophic breaches—that is, exploded.

**Tags:** Difficult, Loud, Pair, Prone, Ranged, Reload, Two-Handed, Vulnerable

**Damage:** 2d10+4 DV

**AP:** -6

**Range:** 20m / 40m / 50m / 60m

**Reload:** 2 Standard Actions per barrel

**Special:** The Trio has three barrels, each of which is loaded and fired separately.  Firing any one barrel is a Standard Action (as normal).  Players who wish to attempt to fire one barrel while their partner fires the other should be swatted with something and told to stop being jerks.

**Special:** If you have a partner helping you operate the weapon, then it looses the Difficult tag (as it is easy for you to aim, and for them to fire).  Working with a partner, you can also reload a barrel with only one Standard Action.  However, performing maneuvers in close formation with a partner is difficult, and so the weapon gains the Awkward tag.

<!-- The hand-cannon was added as an example weapon.
  - Hand Cannon
    
      - It’s supposed to be an arquebus, but we’re trying to use literal
        names; it needs a better name. It’s am example very early
        firearm.
      - The hand-cannon is a portable infantry weapon developed from
        modern artillery. The weapons are awkward: they strike with
        greater force than even a crossbow and can penetrate all but the
        heaviest armor, but they are extremely slow to reload—so much so
        that they usually aren’t reloaded in the field.
      - Attack: Projectile Weapons, 2D10+2 DV, AP -6
      - Range: short 20m / medium 30m / long 35m / extreme 40m
      - Reload: 5 turns (May reduce, since there isn’t a reason this
        should take 5 times as long to reload as a musket.)
      - Tags: Loud, Prone, Two-Handed, Vulnerable

<!-- the Star Trek RPG is not copylefted, and this isn't a great port of the momentum-and-threat rules anyway.
## Momentum and Threat

  - Sometimes you score a critical success on a boring and uninteresting
    check; other times, your players score a critical failure on a
    boring and trivial check; and sometimes nobody can think of a good
    critical effect—what does critically succeeding on a test to make
    three dozen spoons even look like?

  - The Star Trek RPG has a great system for this, and we’re adding it
    as an optional rule.

  - This rule adds two new *pools*, *momentum* and *complications*.
    
      - These pools aren’t individual character stats; instead, they’re
        shared by the party (in the case of *momentum*) and managed by
        the GM (in the case of *complications*).
      - So the party has one shared Momentum pool that everyone uses,
        and the GM has one Threat pool that they will draw from.
      - The GM may choose to let the party see the Threat pool, or to
        keep it secret.

  - Each pool starts at 0, and can be raised as high as the number of
    players, including the GM(s) (so if there are 5 players and 1 GM,
    then each pool can go up to 6).

  - When the players score an exceptional or critical success, they can
    choose to Downgrade. If they do, then they gain (or “bank”) one
    Momentum.

  - Likewise, if an (opponent) NPC scores a Critical or Exceptional
    Success, the GM may choose to Downgrade in order to gain (or bank)
    one Threat.

  - If a player scores an Exceptional or Critical Failure, the GM may
    offer to gain one Threat in exchange for allowing the player to
    Upgrade.

  - A player may spend Momentum to:
    
      - gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Luck Points;
      - gain any benefit they could spend a Fate Point for, according to
        the rules for spending Fate Points (if using the Fate Points
        alternate rules);
      - re-roll a check (at the cost of 2 Momentum);
      - Deal maximum damage with an attack (at the cost of 2 Momentum).

  - A GM may spend Threat to:
    
      - force a player to re-roll a Test;
      - introduce a new obstacle that hinders the players, such as a
        guard showing up at the wrong time or a petty noble deciding
        they’ll spend the rest of the day making the player’s lives Hard
        (at the cost of 2 Threat, so make it a good one\!);
      - have one NPC gain any benefit they could spend a Luck Point for,
        according to the rules for spending Luck Points;
      - halve the damage inflicted by an attack (at the cost of 2
        Threat)

  - Part of the intent of Momentum and Threat is to give them game a
    more cinematic feel; both GMs and players should bear that in mind
    when banking and spending.

  - How momentum is spent is a party decision, which is to say, we
    provide no guidance for what GMs should do if the party doesn’t
    agree on how to spend a Momentum.
    
      - If you’d like to turn your gaming table into a Friendship
        Destruction Simulator, you can try allowing any player to spend
        Momentum unilaterally; be prepared for fratricide.

  - If anyone has some other suggestions for ways to spend Momentum,
    that’d be rad.

## Advanced Firearms

In the real world, there was an era when early firearms coexisted with (steel-prod) crossbows and plate armor, without being clearly superior to the one or completing negating the other; these early, muzzle-loading, smooth-bored, ball-firing black-powder weapons are not wildly disruptive if introduced to a world that already has crossbows and seige weapons.
But the Emerald Plane also has alchemists, blacksmiths, clock-makers, mages and engineers skilled enough to produce an alchemically powered golem-arm; it's certainly not *impossible* that some of these smiths could have developed more advanced guns, decades or centuries ahead of when those weapons where introduced on Earth.

However, unlike Chandra's golem-arm, innovations like the metal cartridge, the breach-loading weapon, the rifled barrel and the pointed bullet are all easily replicated once understood—and any one of them, certainly several of them taken together, could radically alter the balance of power on two continents, should one army suddenly field them.

So, here, we present, as a separate alternate rule from Guns, *Advanced* Firearms.
Advanced firearms are listed separately, and require a GM's separate approval, because they have the potential to take over a game, and to radically alter the setting; while in principle not wildly better than any other Cost: High item, the innovations given here are far more replicable once understood, and represent astonishing leaps in military technology that could totally change the face of warfare should they escape a character's hands—which many GMs may not wish to deal with.

### Rules

We present here a list of *innovations*—modifications that can be applied to a (basic) firearm from the list above.
Using these rules, a player can purchase a gun with one of these innovations as a Cost: High item.
(Subject to the GM's approval, a gun can be purchased with *two* of these innovations as a Cost: Extreme item; however, this is not recommended.)

### Innovations

- **Breach-Loading:** the gun is now reloaded as a Standard Action.
- **Metal Cartridge:** the gun is now reloaded as a Quick Action.  Requires Breach-Loading.
  - Metal cartridges are difficult to produce; they are *tracked* even though they are "standard" ammo, and they are Cost: Medium for 10.
  - Metal cartridges can only be used with balls, slugs and pointed bullets (e.g. they cannot be used with shot or canister rounds).
- **Rifled Barrel:** Double each range increment.  The weapon gains the Accurate tag, and you gain a +10 bonus to your attack checks with it.
  - The weapon can only be used with balls, slugs and pointed bullets (e.g. you cannot use it with shot or canister rounds).
- **Pointed Bullet:** The weapon gains +4 AP.  If taken with the Rifled Barrel, the weapon gains the Very Accurate tag, and you gain an additional +10 bonus to your attack checks with it.

## Raw Materials

  - The rules for crafting tell you that you need “raw materials” to
    craft, but they (implicitly) leave it up to the GM to determine if
    that’s the case.
    
      - The following rules allow players to purchase and track their
        use of raw materials, and are useful for GMs who want to make
        resource management a part of their game.

  - You may purchase raw materials for a given Craft skill—for example,
    “Craft: Alchemy Raw Materials”
    
      - Raw Materials are Moderate items, and have the Heavy tag.

  - When you purchase Raw Materials, they have 20 charges.
    
      - Crafting a Minor item consumes 1 charge.
      - Crafting a Moderate item consumes 5 charges.
      - Crafting a Major item consumes 10 charges.
      - Your raw materials are consumed when they run out of charges.

  - We don’t provide rules for “recharging” Raw Materials: when you
    deplete your Raw Materials, you should simply buy more.

  - Note that raw materials, though heavy, are portable.
    
      - GMs may rule that some tasks require more resources than raw
        materials provide; for example, Craft: Sculpture raw materials
        might not have enough marble to carve a life-sized statue.
      - GMs may also rule that Raw Materials just don’t make sense for
        some skills; for example, enough marble to build a castle would
        cost more than a Moderate item and be more than Heavy, so Craft:
        Masonry Raw Materials might not be allowed.

<!-- These rules where mainlined
## Reactions

  - Consider a caster-character standing behind and to the side of a
    fighter-character; with the rules as they are, nothing stops an
    enemy from simply *walking around* the fighter character and
    attacking the caster character.
    
      - Reactions provide a framework for taking *reactions* outside of
        your turn, which includes as a primary use-case allowing
        fighter-type characters to attack people who try to move past
        them.
      - This allows fighter-types to better control an area, and to
        better defend their team-mates.

  - Using these rules, you may sometimes take actions outside of your
    turn.
    
      - An action taken outside of your turn is called a *reaction*.
      - Once you take a reaction, you cannot take *another* reaction
        until the end of your next turn. (Roughly, you only get one
        reaction per turn.)

  - Readied Actions: as a Standard Action, you may *ready* an action.
    When you ready an action, you specify another Standard Action, and a
    condition; if the condition occurs before your next turn, you may
    choose to take the specified action.
    
      - Activating your a Readied Action is a Reaction.

  - Attacks of Opportunity: if a character who you threaten attempts to
    move away from or past you, you may make an attack against them.
    This uses all the normal rules for an attack.
    
      - Hitting an opponent with an attack of opportunity doesn’t hinder
        their movement, unless you also incapacitate them with your
        attack (by knocking them over for example).
      - An Attack of Opportunity is a Reaction.
-->

## Reputation

  - Characters might be members of guilds, gangs, temples or other
    organizations.
    
      - Tracking their rising and falling status within those
        organizations can be interesting fuel for roleplay and
        adventure, and can help people flesh out their characters.
      - Here are optional rules for tracking character’s *reputations*.

  - If you use these rules, your character can have *reputation(s)* with
    one or more *organization*.
    
      - For each organization that you are known to, you have a
        reputation score (hereafter, “rep”).
      - “Organization” here is used somewhat loosely: it might be a
        literal organization, like a trade guild, but it might also be a
        town, a gang, a temple, a university, or a secret society—or
        just a group of people.
      - Your rep score consists of between 1 and 5 “dots”.
      - At one dot, you’re a new member, just making your way; at 5
        dots, you are a pillar of the community, widely known and
        greatly respected within the organization.
      - (There are potentially infinitely many organizations that you
        are not a member of—with which you have 0 dots. We don’t track
        those for obvious reasons.)
      - Each of your reputation scores might also have either the
        *depleted* or *suspended *tag (or both). These will be described
        below.

  - Example Organizations:
    
      - a specific temple (rep: Bronze Hills Monastery)
      - a commonwealth council organization (rep: Commonwealth Navy, rep
        Commonwealth Engineers)
      - a specific guild (rep: Brier-Treaders Explorer League, rep:
        Heartland Mason’s Guild)
      - a specific university or field of study (rep: Correspondence of
        Heartland Philosophers, rep Haven Isle Astronomical Society)
      - a group of people (rep: Windward Isle Dock-Hands, rep: Citizenry
        of Kareku Aer)

  - When do I need to buy rep?
    
      - You don’t need to buy rep for every single group of people who
        might have heard of you\!
    
      - When you’re trying to decide if you need to buy rep, there are
        two major questions:
        
          - Is my character’s association with this group major enough
            that I want to define it?
          - Mechanically, do I want to be able to call in favors from
            this group while we’re playing the game?
    
      - The last question might actually be the most important. We can
        believe that you’re a citizen of Kareku Aer even if you don’t
        have rep with it; that just means that you’re not someone who
        most people on the street would recognize. It’s only really
        likely to be worth investing in rep if you want to actually be
        able to call in favors from those people during the game.

  - When you create your character, you get four dots for free, which
    you can distribute between any organizations that your character
    might be known to.
    
      - You can purchase more dots at the cost of 10 CP per dot.
      - During character creation, you can’t purchase more than 6 (more)
        dots this way (so your character can’t start the game with more
        than 10 dots).
      - As the game goes on, your character can’t have more than 25 dots
        total.

  - You can use your reputation to call in a *favor* from one of your
    organizations.
    
      - Each favor has a *level*, which the GM assigns. Favor levels run
        from 1 (for a trivial favor) to 5 (for a major ask).
    
      - For example:
        
          - Level 1: craft a Minor object, answer a simple question,
            provide common knowledge, allow use of a workspace, let you
            stay the night.
          - Level 2: answer a complex question, do several hours of
            professional work, take a minor risk, put you up for a week.
          - Level 3: craft a Moderate object, provide valuable
            information, loan a few hundred copper, provide an alibi.
          - Level 4: provide difficult-to-acquire or secret information,
            loan a hundred gold, put you up for a month, provide
            professional service for a week, take a major risk.
          - Level 5: craft a Major item, provide information people
            would die for, loan the use of an estate, let you move in,
            go on a perilous quest with you, help you destroy evidence
          - Favor levels in need of tweaking.
    
      - Under normal circumstances, you can ask for a favor with a
        one-hour task action, requiring a protocol check.
        
          - Success means you get the favor you asked for.
          - If the level of the favor exceeds your rep level (that is,
            the number of dots you have), then you take a -10 penalty.
          - If your rep level exceeds the level of the favor, you take a
            +10 penalty.
          - Note: those are “flat” numbers; it’s *not* +/- 10 per dot of
            difference.
          - “normal circumstances” means that the organization has some
            physical presence where you are, and that the organization
            is in a condition where its (other) members are willing to
            grant people favors. This would be the case, for example, if
            the organization in question is a merchant’s guild that you
            are a member of, and that has other members operating in the
            city that you’re in.
          - Under unusual circumstances—if there aren’t other members in
            the town that you’re in, or if some situation (like a revolt
            or attack) prevents the organization from operating—you
            might have to do more work to call in a favor, or it might
            not even be possible at all.

  - Why don’t I just get one dot in a network, get really high protocol,
    and then make those people kill for me?
    
      - Technically you can, but you’ll only get away with it once;
        after that, you’ll gain the depleted tag (see below).
      - If you keep doing that every month—abusing them for obscene
        favors and then working the debt off—the GM might eventually
        decide that the members of that organization are sick your
        shenanigans and either dock you rep, or just suspend you
        outright (see below).
      - It’s also not particularly efficient, unless you were going to
        buy 50 ranks in protocol anyway.

  - Several factors can effect your reputations.
    
      - Your reputations can go up and down—you can gain or loose dots.
        
          - This is usually hard to do: gaining a dot requires either
            years of service, or an accomplishment of major note, or
            both.
          - Likewise, loosing a dot requires months of negligence, or a
            significant failure, or both.
          - Which is to say, either awarding or removing dots should
            usually be used to highlight major achievements or failures,
            respectively.
          - Once you have dots, you can’t go below zero (except in
            exceptional circumstances). If you would loose your last
            dot, you gain the Suspended tag instead.
          - Similarly, you can’t go over five dots. If you would gain a
            sixth dot, the GM should allow you to call in a Level 4
            favor “for free” instead. (The favor is subject to GM
            approval.)
    
      - If you ask for too many favors in too short a time—or if you
        (successfully) ask for a favor that exceeds your rep level by
        too much—then people won’t be willing to do more favors for you
        until you do something for the organization.
        
          - When this happens, that rep network gains the *depleted*
            tag. When your rep network has the *depleted* tag, you can’t
            use that network for favors (even though your actual score
            hasn’t changed).
          - To remove the *depleted* tag, you need to do enough work for
            the organization that members feel that you have “paid your
            debt” to them.
          - As a rough guideline, this can usually be done with a one
            month job, requiring a successful check with an appropriate
            skill (often a profession appropriate to the organization).
    
      - If you fail your organization spectacularly, betray them, or
        otherwise earn their ire, you might get the *suspended* tag.
        
          - When you are *suspended*, the members of the rep network
            treat you as an outsider—you dots with them don’t actually
            change, but you are treated as if you had 0 dots.
          - You obviously cannot use a rep network that you are
            suspended from, and the members of that network might even
            be actively hostile to you (depending on the group’s norms
            and rules, and on what you did to get suspended).
          - You can work your way back into the organization’s good
            graces—you can remove the suspended tag—but it’s hard to do.
          - There are no hard-and-fast rules for removing the suspended
            status. The details of how you do it will depend on the
            organization and why you got suspended.
          - (Of course, a character removing the Suspended status might
            be an adventure unto itself\!)
    
      - When should characters get Suspended, and when should characters
        loose dots?
        
          - Loosing dots usually isn’t the result of a single event. It
            usually happens slowly: as a character shows less and less
            commitment to an organization, its members think less and
            less of that character.
          - Getting Suspended usually *is* the result of a single, major
            failure or betrayal.
          - As a general rule, if you’re about to dock a character more
            than one dot of rep at a time, you should probably Suspend
            them instead.
          - The Suspended tag is also more useful in situations where
            the character might have some reason for what they did, or
            where it might be possible for the character to redeem
            themselves.

  - New Negative Trait: Blacklisted
    
      - You are permanently suspended from one organization.
      - You should work with the GM to design the organization, and the
        GM must approve it.
      - The organization must be one that it would be useful to you to
        be a member of—for example, it must be an organization that you
        would otherwise be in a position to ask favors of, or that you
        would otherwise be rewarded with rep in.
      - If you use the rules for buying off negative traits, then,
        before you can ever gain rep in the blacklisted network, you
        must *first* buy off this trait *and then* remove the Suspended
        tag as normal.

  - New Negative Trait: Internal Enemy
    
      - requires the Enemy trait, that your enemy is a member of an
        organization that you have at least 3 dots of rep in.
      - Your enemy is a member of an organization that you are also a
        member of. They will attempt to ruin your reputation and foil
        your attempts to call in favors.
      - Whenever you attempt to call in a favor, if your enemy is aware
        of what you are doing, they will work against you: you suffer a
        -20 penalty on the test.
      - Once a month, you must make an opposed Protocol check against
        your enemy. If you fail, you gain the *depleted* tag with that
        organization.

  - New Positive Trait: Networking
    
      - You are very good at managing and promoting your reputation with
        one organization.
      - You do not take the -10 penalty if you call in a favor that
        exceeds your rep by only one.
      - When you are about to gain the Depleted tag, you may attempt a
        Protocol check at -30. If you succeed, you do not gain the
        Depleted tag.

  - Modified Trait: Wanted
    
      - You cannot call in favors from an organization that you are
        Wanted by (that is, that you purchased this trait for).
