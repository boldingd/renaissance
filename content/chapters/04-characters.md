## Character Creation

Proceed through the following steps in order:

-   For Free:

    -   60 ranks in your native language (pick an appropriate one)
    -   10 ranks in Language: Common (Commonwealth Standard)
    -   1 Luck

-   Choose Aptitudes

    -   Characters start with a rating of 15 in each Aptitude
    -   add to one Aptitude by subtracting equally from another.

-   Pick your race, which will include:

    -   Aptitude Bonuses
    -   Health (DUR), Strength (STR) and Size
    -   senses and movement
    -   other special properties

-   15 tweak points

    -   add 1 to an Aptitude
    -   add 1 to your Durability
    -   add 1 to your Strength

-   Pick your Background

    -   The bonuses granted by your Background "apply" now. In
        particular, that means that, if your background grants you skill
        ranks, then those are your "first" ranks in that skill -- you
        will have them before you start spending CP.
    -   Skill Ranks granted by your background work exactly like ranks
        that you paid fore.
    -   So, if your background gives you 10 ranks in Barter, you can buy
        20 more ranks for 20 CP (1 a piece), and then 20 more ranks for
        40 CP (2 CP a piece), and be at the maximum of 50 ranks during
        Character Creation.

-   800 Creation Points

    -   1 CP → 1 point in a skill (30 or fewer skill points purchased)
    -   2 CP → 1 skill point (31^st^ skill point, and there-after)
    -   10 CP → a trait
    -   10 CP → a class
    -   10 CP → a power
    -   15 CP → +1 Luck
    -   5 CP → A specialization

        -   you must have 10 ranks in the skill, see _Skills_

    -   Items:

        -   1 CP → minor (simple) item
        -   5 CP → normal (useful) item
        -   10 CP → major (magical) item
        -   see _Items_

-   Motivations

    -   Ideally, three one-word descriptions, with a + ("support" or
        "pro") or a - ("against")
    -   For Example: +Wealth +Freedom -Shade Elves
    -   Motivations are abstract, long-term goals; they're the causes
        your character is dedicated too. They shouldn't be short term,
        and most of the really good ones can't even be completely
        achieved at all!

-   Character Creation Limits

    -   no more than 50 ranks in a skill
    -   no aptitudes higher than 35 (including racial bonus and tweak
        points) or lower than 5
    -   at least 200 CP spent on skills with the _combat _tag
    -   at least 200 CP spent on skills that don't have the _combat
        _tag

-   Global Limits

    -   no more than 70 ranks in a skill
    -   no aptitude higher than 40 (any excess is wasted)
    -   no more than 10 Luck
    -   no more than 50 DUR or STR

## Character Advancement

As characters operate in the world (and especially as they complete
adventures), they will gain Rez Points (RP); RP rewards are the primary
method by which characters advance, and are the primary reward for most
adventures. Characters can spend rez to advance during down-time, using
the same rules by which they spent CP during character creation. When
spending rez, the character-creation limits no longer apply, although
the global limits still do.

We don't have rules for training requirements, but gaining new skills
should generally make sense. Skills and classes can be justified either
by events during the adventure, or effort undertaken during down-time.
You usually cannot gain new Backgrounds, and there are some Traits that
you cannot buy with Rez (at the GM's discretion).

See also the "Buying Off Negative Traits" optional rule.

## NPCs and Followers

NPCs and Followers use slightly different rules. As opposed to Player
Characters (those characters that are controlled by the Players),
Non-Player Characters are controlled by the GM and used to populate the
world. Most NPCs will not have complete statistics; most NPCs will only
have stats appropriate to their roll, such as a shop-keeper only having
a Barter skill, a Protocol skill and a certain number of Trade Goods.
"Major NPCs" are those that are prominent in a campaign -- a friendly
noble who gives the players their mission, for example, or the
arch-villain of the campaign. Finally, Followers are "friendly"
characters associated with a player, such as an assistant or helper. It
is generally advised that players be allowed to control their Followers,
although the GM may prevent a Player from having a Follower do something
completely unreasonable (like mortally wounding themselves, or giving
the Player Character all their material wealth.)

Major NPCs, NPCs and Followers use the standard Character Creation
rules, except for the following:

-   Major NPCs receive 1 Luck for free like PCs, but cannot purchase
    additional Luck.
-   Minor NPCs do not receive Luck, cannot purchase Luck, and start with
    only 10 in each Aptitude.
-   Followers do not receive Luck, cannot purchase Luck, and receive a
    lower number of Creation Points. The feature that is granting a
    Follower will specify how many Creation Points they receive, and
    might specify other limits as well.

## Senses, Movements and Special Abilities

The following are common Senses, Movement types and Special Abilities.
This list is by no means exhaustive.

## Senses

-   Normal: the normal senses that humans have
-   Blind-Sight: you have the ability to sense your surroundings, even
    when you cannot see; this might be a result of the heightening of
    your other sense, it might be a mechanism like a bat's sonar, or it
    might be a supernatural ability. Even in conditions of total
    darkness, you can perceive your environment, including any object
    larger than a human fist, out to a distance of 30m. You cannot
    perceive color or fine detail. Perception tests made with
    Blind-Sight suffer a -20 penalty.

    -   This is more like D&D Dark-Vision than I wanted it to be; I did
        not want to add off-brand Dark Vision.

-   Infra-red: you can see in infra-red. This is particularly useful at
    night.
-   Low-Light: creature can see clearly in low-light conditions (but not
    total darkness).
-   Mage-Sight: you can perceive magical energy. You can see active
    magical effects, and you can attempt to determine what a magical
    effect is by studying it (a 10 minute task action, requiring an
    appropriate Knowledge check).
-   Scent: you have an extremely keen sense of smell. This allows you to
    detect many sneaking creatures, and to identify things by smell.
-   Tremor-sense: when in contact with a solid object, you can sense
    vibrations propagating through it. This allows you to sens
    approaching footfalls through the ground, for example.

## Movement Modes

General Rules:

-   Creatures have several different movement modes.
-   Most movement modes list _walking_ and _running_ rates

    -   see _Combat_ for rules about movement rates in combat.

-   Some movement modes also list a _maximum speed_, which is the
    maximum speed allowed for that movement mode.

    -   We don't have detailed rules for acceleration; as a rough guide,
        for movement modes with a maximum speed, you can add either your
        Walking or Running rate to your current speed in any given turn.

-   Most movement modes have a _linked skill_, which is used for tests
    regarding that movement mode. Tests are usually called for when
    difficult maneuvers are made (such as running across a slick
    surface), when attempting to _sprint_ (see _Combat_) or as opposed
    tests during _chase scenes_.

    -   Most movement modes, including Walking movement, use the
        Athletics skill.
    -   Flying movement use the Flying skill.
    -   Mounted movement uses the Riding skill.
    -   Other movements mode, such as Burrowing movement, use the Exotic
        Movement skill.

Movement Modes:

-   Burrowing: you can burrow through the ground. You can choose to
    leave a tunnel behind you or not. Some soil, such as hard or rocky
    soil, cannot be burrowed through. If you have Burrowing as a
    movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while burrowing.

    -   Linked to Exotic Movement: Burrowing

-   Climbing: you can climb as easily as humans can walk. Note that some
    creatures can't climb some surfaces (someone that climbs with claws,
    like a cat, cannot climb on glass or metal, for example).

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

-   Flying: you can fly.

    -   Linked to the Flying skill.

-   Leaping: you move in a series of hops, like a kangaroo or frog.

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.
    -   Less hindered by broken group or small gaps

-   Swimming: you can swim as easily as humans can walk. If you have a
    Swim movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while underwater
    (presuming you need to breathe).

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

-   Walking: bipedal movement.

    -   Linked to the Athletics skill.

## Abilities

-   Fast Healing: when you have Fast Healing _k_, you reduce your Damage
    by _k_ each turn -- normally healing by 20 \* _k_ a minute. Every
    day, you may recover from one wound (what it might look like
    half-way through this process is best not thought about).
-   Motion-Sensitive: your senses are particularly sensitive to motion.
    You receive a +10 bonus to Perception checks made against moving
    targets.

## Sizes

-   The affects of being a different size are generally not represented
    mechanically (i.e. there is no "size modifier table").
-   Being _small_ or _large_ might confer bonuses in some situations,
    such as making it easier (if small) or harder (if large) to use
    Stealth; these are at the GM's discretion.
-   See also _Sizes_ in Combat.
