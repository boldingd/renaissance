title: The Five Roles
---

  - The five roles:
    
      - Combat
      - Knowledge
      - Social
      - Stealth
      - Support

  - GMs should try to balance all 5 roles.
    
      - Each is equally important.
      - Each should get equal time.
      - Any given challenge should be solvable by several roles.
      - Obviously, this can’t always be the case; it’s the goal.

  - Players should cover more than one role.
    
      - A player character should usually be *great* in one role, and
        *good* at two more.
      - Great generally means relevant skills in the 65-80 range, with
        good investment in relevant items.
      - Good usually means relevant skills in the 50-65 range, with
        workable investment in relevant items.
      - Remember that, in any given scene, any one role has the same
        chance to be relevant (or irrelevant) as all the others roles.
