## The Kingdoms of Men

The Kingdoms of Men are a human nation that lies to the northeast of the Dragonshire; it arose from the ashes of the Empire of Man more than a century after it had collapsed.

They are Kingdoms in more than name alone; the society consists of a
large number of local nobles, tied together in a complex web of
allegiances.  At present, there are 23 kings as such, more than 35 independent landed nobles (though some of their territories are no larger than a town), and more than a hundred noble families besides.

The allegiances that bind the Kingdom together are very fragile; they can shift, form and break all too quickly.
Because of this, the Kingdoms' politics can be incredibly treacherous, as different power-blocks jostle for control.

Only sometimes can one King credibly claim rulership over all (or just
*enough*) of the Kingdoms to claim the title of High King---and such a High King's rule is often tenuous, as they will never be without enemies, rivals and usurpers.

There have been three High Kingships in the Kingdoms' history.
There first High Kingship lasted from CY 255 to CY 281; this short-lived dynasty collapsed 10 years after passing form its founder to its first heir, rent apart by an internal power struggle. The second High Kingship lasted from CY 361 to CY 435; these High Kings were substantially more warlike, and were in constant conflict with both the Dragonshire to their east and the Goblin Kings to their South.  The second Kingship collapsed after a series of disastrous military adventures between CY 429-CY 433.  The third High Kingship began in CY 695, and has lasted to the present day.  This High Kingship had good relations with the Dragonshire, and now has good relations with the Commonwealth.

The Kingdoms can be roughly divided between their western and eastern halves.  The western Kingdoms are relatively open; they have benefited heavily from trade with the Commonwealth, and have little interest in conflict with their wealthy and powerful neighbor.  Unsurprisingly, the present High King hails from a city-state in the western Kingdoms.

The eastern Kingdoms are far more cruel; the Three Cities that built the Empire lie in the eastern portion, and to this day many of the residents there are quick to believe that humans should hold dominion over all other races (and that those whose ancestors built the Empire should hold dominion over all other humans).

The current High King is one Kass Ahnaff, who is the king of the city-kingdom of Annhallan (styled as Wise Westking and Merchentmen City in Common).  Merchentmen City is in the Western Kingdoms; it lies not on the border with the Commonwealth, but rather near the shores of the Kings' Sea.  Kass has enthusiastically pursued better relations with the Commonwealth, and has made only the barest pretense to disguise his willingness to cooperate with the Commonwealth to combat the nobles of the East who would see him deposed.  Many easterners view Kass as the worst human being alive.

### The Kingdoms' Economy

The Kingdoms are a relatively wealthy and sophisticated society, particularly in the West, where they have benefited heavily with trade with the Dragonshire the Commonwealth.
During the peace that has prevailed between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms since 695, merchants have crossed the borders between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms, enriching communities on both sides; notably, rivers running east from the Worldspine give Commonwealth merchants easy access to the many ports on the Kings' Sea, the large inland sea that separates the Kingdoms of Men from the Goblin Empire.

Notably, knowledge also crosses the border, as scholars and innovations from the Dragonshire often cross into the Kingdoms, and vice versa.

Unfortunately, this thriving trade does put strain on the east-west divide within the Kingdoms; Commonwealth traders seldom venture into the Eastern Kingdoms, and so the wealth produced by trade is concentrated in the west.

### Other Races

The Kingdoms of Men is a government of men, in their traditional territories; with few exceptions, they have not treated with the other races that may have dwelt within their borders, and instead have displaced them; any that remain are not recognized and citizens, but can only ever be subjects of the Kingdoms.

There is one notable exception; the Kingdom of Haffa in the northwest.  Elves and humans are nearly unique in that they are able to interbreed, although these hybrids are usually sterile (and often suffer other ailments); the half-human, half-elven population of much of Haffa, including the noble line that rules the kingdom, are exceptions to this rule---they are not sterile, and do not commonly suffer any other ailment from their mixed blood.  (It is rumored that magical intervention may have been required to achieve this; whether this is true---and if so, what that intervention was, or what price was likely paid---has been lost to history.)

Unsurprisingly, the Haffa are enemies-by-necessity of the Eastern Kingdoms, who view them as mongrels and half-breeds at best; the Haffa are strong supporters of the current High King and his line.  Notably, though, they usually have no special affinity for tribal Elves living within the Commonwealth's borders, and to the west of the Worldspine.

Conversely, a particularly grim moment in the history of the Kingdoms' relations with an attempt launched in the Eastern Kingdoms to exterminate their indigenous Kobold population; this led to a mass exodus of Kobolds from the entire Kingdoms.  A few scant pockets of Kobold populations remain in the Western Kingdoms; some settled in the Dragonshire, owing partly to their ability to speak the Drakes' language; far larger number settled deep under the Worldspine; and many more still continued on to the Haven Isles.  In the Commonwealth, Kobolds have prospered and become numerous; this is not the least of the reasons that the Commonwealth views the Eastern Kingdoms as their enemy.

### The Military

Rapid improvements in the quality and availability of steel plate armor---in both the Kingdoms and the Dragonshire---have been the major driver of military tactics in the Kingdoms.  The Kingdoms have sophisticated-enough metallurgy that they can produce large numbers of weapons and armors made of high-quality steel, but they cannot produce it on the scale that the Commonwealth can, and so steel plate armor in particular remains primarily the province of knights (who are often drawn from the ranks of the noble and the wealthy).

Knights are among the most iconic of the Kingdoms' combatants; horse-mounted human Knights in full plate are mobile, heavily-armored and difficult to strike, making them a devastating force on the battlefield.  Many of the kingdoms have long traditions of horse-back riding and archery; because of this, besides mounted Knights, the Kingdoms can boast large numbers of skilled light cavalry and archers---especially masters of the devastating-though-difficult longbow.  In recent years, however, the prominence of longbow archers has fallen away, as the Kingdoms now commonly arms its peasant infantry with easy-to-use and powerful crossbows.

In its early years, each noble and each kingdom was responsible for contributing to the Kingdoms' military from their own resources; though the Kingdoms where often capable of fielding a large and effective army, they could suffer from inconsistent standards of equipment, composition and discipline.  One innovation achieved during the interregnum between the Second and Third High Kings was a standardization of the kinds of combatants that each kingdom was expected to furnish.  Though the *enforcement* of these standards is still subject to the Kingdoms' internal politics, their military is nevertheless far more consistent and unified today than it has been in centuries past.

The Kingdoms typically view their Knights as their most elite and powerful combatants, and they are typically the centerpiece of their military strategy.  After the Knights, their light cavalry and archers are their most prominent forces.  They often field a small number of professional infantry, who they place at the front of their lines, and support with larger numbers of mercenaries, mustered peasants and even conscripted prisoners; unsurprisingly, the discipline, morale and effectiveness of the last two categories can vary widely.

Though not a fact that is often spoken aloud---especially in the Eastern Kingdoms---the Kingdoms of Men are entirely militarily overmatched by the Commonwealth.  Though the Commonwealth cannot boast the large number of Knights that the Kindgoms can, the Commonwealth is richer, has better access to steel, is *much* larger, has a much larger professional military, and can draw on the much greater physical strength of Gnolls and Drakes.

The Kingdoms, however, *are* a match for their neighbor to the south, the Goblin Empire, which led the Goblins in years past to sail south from the Emerald Plane and seek riches (and weaker opponents) on the Ruby Plane.  This influx of wealth (and new source of fighting experience for their infantry), however, has led to a significant improvement in the Goblin Empire's military; this in turn has not escaped the notice of the Kingdoms of Men.

### Other Nations

At present, the Kingdoms of Men are at peace with the Commonwealth, and are not at war with the Goblin Empire.
The High King has fostered good relations with the people of the Commonwealth, and the people of the Western Kingdom have prospered from it.
This state of affairs is precarious, however, as many within the Eastern Kingdoms would dearly love to seize the thrown---and thereafter to reclaim long-lost territories from the Dragonshire, to law the Commonwealth and the Goblin Empire low, and to restore humanity to preeminence in the land east of the Worldspine.

They could never achieve this on their own, however, even *if* they could command the undisputed loyalty of all the kings and nobles of the Kingdoms of Men; therefore, the nobles of the East are searching for allies.

The rulers of the West are not ignorant of this---the kings of the far east are seldom subtle in their contempt for non-humans---and so they are seeking allies, too.  And so, the struggle for rule of the Kingdoms of Men has become something of a proxy war between all the great powers of the continent.

If the Easterners can seize control of the Kingdoms, and if they strike an alliance with the Goblin Empire and the Shaded Sea Peoples---even a temporary one---then the Commonwealth is doomed; if, however, the current high-king can solidify his control, then an alliance with the Commonwealth is a possibility---and should that happen, the Shaded Sea People and the Goblinoid Empire would in turn be hopelessly outmatched.

Fortunately for the Commonwealth and the Western Kingdoms, a nightmare alliance between the Shaded Sea People, the Goblins and the Eastern Kingdoms seems unlikely; the Human and Goblin nations have a long history of conflict, and the Shaded Sea People have no significant contact with either; what's more, the Eastern Kingdom's obvious contempt for non-humans would make such an alliance difficult to strike (and impossible to sustain).

## The Shaded Sea People

  - Alliance of Ratfolk and Shade Elves.
  - Shade elves originate in the Southwestern corner of the Emerald
    Plane, where they were a fearsome mounted raiding people.
  - Ratfolk originate in an island chain 300km off the coast, where they
    where skilled sailors.
  - Complex history of raiding and violence.
  - Both Shade Elves and then Ratfolk where forced to pay tribute by a
    third, rarely-encountered people, the Leapers.
  - They raided each-other to meet the tribute demands, until some 400
    years ago, when they instead allied with each other and turned to
    raiding the Commonwealth.
  - Their siege of Islandholme in CY 447 is a major turning point; their
    devastating defeat depletes the resources of the houses that mounted
    the attack.
  - They turned to raiding the Ratfolk who had settled on the Raptor’s
    Plane, fleeing their cruel cousins; this ended when they allied with
    the Raptors, and eventually ejected the Shaded Sea Peoples from
    Raptor’s Plane.
  - At present, they are still an active piratical and raiding culture,
    and they still have several “client” populations in the Shaded Sea
    and on Emerald Plane.

## The Raptors' Protectorate

  - The Raptors' Protectorate
  - On the Raptor’s Plane, in the North-West and Central regions of the
    continent.
  - An alliance formed almost 400 years ago to resist piracy and raiding
    by Shaded Sea People.
  - United the Raptors with Ratfolk who had settled on the North-West
    shore, fleeing the cruelty of their cousins.
  - First contacted 300 years ago, with heavy travel beginning 200 years
    ago.
  - Friendly with the Commonwealth, though independent.
  - May be forced into closer alliance, as they are pressured by Goblins
    on the Eastern shore and Shaded Sea peoples on the West.

## The Goblin Empire

Goblins have long dwelled in the southeastern reaches of the Emerald Plane, their culture ruled by Kings and Warlords—and infamous for the sale and brutalization of intelligent beings as slaves.
Since the rise of the Dragonshire—and especially since the Kingdoms of Men reformed from the remains of the Empire of Man—the Goblins have been the weakest major power in the East.

Their fortunes have changed dramatically since the creation of the Goblin Empire and their conquest of the Ruby Plane.

### Kings, Warlords, Emperors and the Code

Goblin society is ruled by Kings and Warlords.
Kings control cities, towns and territories—the means for food, industry and trade.
Warlords, in turn, control bands of Goblin fighters.
Kings jostle amongst themselves, forming alliances and competing for power, but they also compete for the services of warlords; kings' arrangements with warlords are openly mercenary—there is little pretense of honor, loyalty or higher causes—and they can be extremely fragile.

Unsurprisingly, rule in Goblin society can be extremely unstable.

This does not have as great an impact on Goblin society as it could, however, because law and commerce are not administered by their Kings; instead, they have a parallel legal system, founded in the Code, and administered by Judges.

#### The Code

Originally called the *North Coast Code,* the Code was a formalization of the customs used to govern trade between several cities on the southern coast of the Glass Sea—the sea between the Kingdoms of Men and the Goblins.
Though it was only originally intended as a trading agreement between a handful of cities, it began to spread; though it doesn't claim to be ordained great spirits, destiny or fate, it has nevertheless come to occupy a central place in Goblin society.

The Code has evolved over the centuries; eight major schools of legal scholarship have developed, and each has accepted modifications to the Code itself—the Code never claimed to be unmodifiable, although no procedure for amending it was specified.
In general, there is little competition between Schools; Goblins tend to view each of the schools as being equally valid, thinking of them much like the way that members of the Commonwealth think of different provinces.

Judges as such are few: there may be only three or four in a city of five thousand.
They have the support of clerks, scholars, and Enforcers—though the ranks of the Enforcers will be fewer than the forces of local Kings and Warlords, they are numerous enough to enforce the Judge's judgments on the populace.
Those who appear before Judges can hire Advocates—scholars of the law who specialize in pleading before Judges.
Advocates' skills are highly valuable, and they are often important, powerful and wealthy members of their communities.

#### Kings-by-the-Assembly

The Second High Kingship of the Kingdoms of Men (CY 361-435) was particularly warlike, and cost the Goblin Kingdoms heavily.
In CY 377, an unprecedented step was taken: several desperate northern Kings called their peers to an assembly, with the purpose of selecting one among their number to lead their combined forces, the better to resist the Kingdoms of Men.
In early CY 378, the First king-by-the-Assembly was appointed.

The First King-by-the-Assembly had the loyalty of most Kings—and could exploit the internal peace to buy most Warlords—and was able to rally stronger resistance to the Kingdoms; however, they where still overmatched.
The first King-by-the-Assembly served until CY 417.

The only other King-by-the-Assembly ruled from 541 to 563; the line ended when the king's daughter was assassinated less than 6 months after taking the throne.

The Third High Kingship of the Kingdoms of Men (CY 695), the peace between the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire (beginning in CY 698), and the incorporation of the Dragonshire into the Commonwealth at the signing of the Commonwealth Compact (CY 744) spelled the end of the Goblins as a major power on the Emerald Plane; the new Commonwealth was far too vast, wealthy and powerful for the Goblin Kings to compete with.

#### The Empire

Goblins hailing from southern kingdoms first sailed far enough south to reach the Ruby Plane in CY 538; they found in the northeastern Ruby Plane an arid land, populated by relatively primitive people—a land the could plunder, full of people who would be their slaves.
Goblin sailing techniques rapidly improved, and by CY 617 they had established a permanent outpost on the northern shore of the Ruby Plane.

In CY 703, the Noble Assembly once again appointed a ruler—this time an Empress.
She was given the power to assembly an Empire—to raise taxes, to build an Imperial administration, and to levy the forces of the kings and warlords and place them under her command.
She was given this power for the express purpose of efficiently conquering and plundering the Ruby Plane.

The Goblin Empire has seen a rapid rise in the Goblin's fortune.
They have conquered a large swath of the northeast Ruby Plane, displacing, enslaving or exterminating many of the native races in the process.
The territory on the Ruby Plane is now larger than their territory on the Emerald Plane—though they still rule this territory from the Emerald Plane.

In characteristic style, modern Goblin society has at least three centers of power, who compete as much as they cooperate: The Imperial administration rules their society, but only so long as it has the consent of the Kings—only so long as it enriches the Kings with treasure plundered from the Ruby Plane—and the Kings try to keep the Empire on a short leash.
And through it all, the Judges remain, ruling on matters of law and custom.

### The Economy—and Slavery

Slaves have long been one of the chief resources of the Goblin economy—the North Coast Code specifically granted Goblins the right to take any non-Goblin as a slave, and very few scholars of the Code have questioned this provision or called for change.

Acquiring slaves on their home plane grew more and more difficult as the other peoples and nations of the eastern Emerald Plane grew stronger; it effectively became impossible with the signing of the Commonwealth Compact, as they could no longer risk the wrath of the Commonwealth.

The Ruby Plane has become the chief source of slaves and plunder, and the economy of the Goblin Empire now revolves around the conquest and exploitation of the Ruby Plane and her people; this transformation has brought the Empire unprecedented wealth and prosperity.

### The Imperial Military

Goblin metal-working has long lagged behind that of the Kingdoms of Men and the Dragonshire; owing to their long talons, awkward hands, and stiff bone-plated backs, they have never been able to ride horses well; and the forces of Kings and Warlords are often highly heterogeneous—and almost always reinforced with slaves.
All of these factors have meant that the Goblin Kings have long lagged behind the other militaries of the Emerald Plane.

Still, they are not without advantages.
Several Goblin Kingdoms have cultivated expertise in chemistry, alchemy and medicine, and they have used these skills to turn their slave ranks into forces to be feared.

They have also used their time on the Ruby Plane wisely.
Though the troops levied from Kings and Warlords may vary widely in tactics, composition and quality, the Empire has reorganized them into regular units, drilled them, and deployed them together; this has led to rapid improvements in their coordination.
The Empire has also experimented with new technologies—they are the only power besides the Commonwealth to experiment with guns and cannons.

#### The Infantry

Goblins commonly use large formations of infantry equipped with long spears or pikes.
The first two ranks carry shields: the first rank will fight kneeling, with their spears braced at their feet and their shields readied, while the second rank fights standing and holding their shield up—though also with their spears braced.
The ranks behind them fight with their spears or pikes held overhead, attacking by thrusting.

These pike-wielding formations can be extraordinarily deadly, but they are also very vulnerable if they are flanked; for this reason, support is essential.
The flanks of these formations are often guarded by ranks equipped with crossbows or hand-cannons—Goblins are not well designed for the use of bows, but they can use guns and crossbows effectively.

Goblins do not field heavy cavalry the way the Kingdoms of Men do—although they do field deadly light cavalry.
Gremlins do not have long talons interfering with their ability to grip, they do not have bony plates impeding their flexibility, they are light enough to ride two-to-a-horse, and—vitally—they can be trusted enough to play a vital role in a fighting force, unlike other slaves.
Gremlins ride two-to-a-horse, typically in light armor, carrying guns or crossbows; though they are almost incapable of mounting a charge like mounted human Knights can, they make deadly skirmishers and archers.
Because there is a separate jockey and crossbow-wielder or cannoneer, they can fire effectively while moving at speed; because they are so fast and mobile, they can close to a much shorter range without feer of being effectively engaged—even by enemy archers.
And because they are so lite and quickly, they are particularly effective at running down an enemy who breaks; this capability is very important, as it has allowed the Goblin Empire to turn many partial victories into devastating routes.
Sometimes, these light cavalry will carry man-catchers, nets, bolos and other weapons designed to debilitate and capture fleeing enemies; a future of misery and slavery awaits those so captured—and wealth and reward awaits the Gremlin who captures many future slaves.

When operating in smaller units, Goblins often field a single formation, of mixed pike-wielders and crossbow-wielders.
Each rank will be a mix of pikes and crossbows; in the first two ranks, the pike-wielders will also carry shields.
When the enemy is at range, the crossbow-wielders will stand next to the pike-wielders; the pikes will cover them with their shields.
As the enemy closes, the crossbows will step back into the pikes, who will close ranks in front of them; if the enemy engages the formation in melee, the crossbows will fight with their talons.
This requires careful coordination; if order collapses, the results are likely to be catastrophic.
The Goblin Empire drills these formation often, and is careful to arrange troop rotations so that all of their infantry have experience deploying these tactics in combat.

Though Goblin Kings have long made use of slave rabble in their military tactics, the Goblin Empire is less willing to do so; the loyalty and reliability of slaves recently acquired from the cultures of the Ruby Plane remain a serious concern.
Still, some generals do press slaves into service—especially members of larger and more battle-capable races; these slaves are often paid a wage and afforded better treatment, the better to secure their loyalty.

#### The Navy

The Goblin navy is vital for connecting their territories on the Ruby Plane with their homeland.
This navy is primarily a defensive and logistical force—protecting their landings, ferrying troops and equipment from the mainland and riches back home.

### Other Nations

While the Goblin Empire has made no peace overture to the Kingdoms of Men or the Commonwealth as such, they have avoided any conflict with those powers.

The Goblin Empire is, of course, an enemy of the Raptors' Protectorate, and the two are at war; indeed, the very mission of the Protectorate is to provide a safe refuge from the predations of the Shaded Sea Peoples and the Goblin Empire.
So far, however, direct conflict has been minimal: the Protectorate lags behind the Empire in technological sophistication and military capability, and so they have focused on securing their borders and integrating and arming their refugee populations.

The Commonwealth has been slow to form an alliance with the Raptors' Protectorate—they are slow to start a war that may consume half a continent on another's behalf—but sympathy for the Protectorate has long been strong in the Commonwealth, and relations between the two have been strengthening.
The Goblins know that such an alliance is coming, and that they may lack the diplomatic means to stop it; in recent years, they have begun to prepare to fight a war on two fronts.

Even though the Commonwealth has not yet formally allied with the Protectorate, they have long meddled in the affairs of the Goblin Empire—through spies directly commissioned by the council, and through the tacit support of organizations like the High Road.

While some kings have sought allies among the kings and nobles of the Eastern Kingdoms, such overtures have not yet been fruitful, and the Empire has not yet given them its official support; the southern Human Kingdoms have long been enemies of the Goblin Kings, and the Kings of the East are slow to forgive.

The Goblins have little contact with the Shaded Sea Peoples, as a continent separates the two (and because the Commonwealth patrols the sea south of their borders, cutting off an ocean route).
