title: "Common Hazards"
---

As players explore, fight, sneak about, and otherwise adventure, they'll encounter many hazards; here, we have compiled only a few.

What is true elsewhere is true here: these rules are only guidelines, which GM's should use, adapt or discard as the situation (and their intent) merits.

## Mundane Hazards

### Falling

There are few hazards more mundane than falling.

When a player hits the ground (or some other solid obstruction that puts an abrupt and unyielding end to their fall), they take damage based (primarily) on how far they fell.
To determine how much damage a character takes, first compute their *effective falling distance* (which is the distance that they fell, plus any appropriate modifier from the table below)
Then, look up their *falling damage* on the given table.

Damage taken from a fall ignores armor (plate armor doesn't help you if you've fallen off a parapet).

| Effective Falling Distance | Damage | 
| -------------------------- | ------ |
| 2m or less | no damage |
| 6m or less | (distance - 2)d10 DV |
| 10m or less | (distance)d10 DV |
| more than 10m | killed |

| Modifier | Effect | 
| -------- | ------ |
| Successful Roll (requires Athletics check) | -2m |
| Very Hard Surface (stone, brick) | +1m |
| Soft Surface (sand, grass) | -1m |
| Very Soft Surface (pile of goose down) | -2m |

### Fire

Fire is a common hazard—the consequences of its misuse can run from a minor burn up to a destroyed city.

Small fires—like candles—are not particularly dangerous.
While they might light combustible materials on fire, they only deal 1d10÷3 DV on their own.
Armor applies (without modification) to damage caused by small flames.

Being exposed to a larger fire—like falling into a camp-fire—is more dangerous, and does 1d10 DV per turn that the character is exposed (including the first).
If a character is engulfed in flames, there is (obviously) a much higher risk that they (or their garments, or anything that they are holding) will catch fire.

Ordinarily, attacks with the *Fire* tag do not *automatically* set a character on fire—although this may happen on an exceptional success, at the GM's discretion.

A character who has been *set on fire* themselves takes 1d10 DV per turn as long as they are on fire; only apply this damage as long as they are not *engulfed* in flames as above (effectively, you're either *in* fire, or *on* fire, but not both).

Armor is only partly effective against fire: if you trip into a camp-fire, plate armor may save you at first, but it will also heat up; eventually, if you don't get out, your own red-hot armor will be doing as much damage as the fire.
For every turn that you are exposed to fire, reduce the AV of (one of) your worn metal armor(s) by 1.
Once the AV (of all your worn metal armors) reaches 0, start adding *heat points*; you gain one *heat point* per turn (in which you are wearing metal armor, that has no AV left, and that you are exposed to fire).
You take 1d10 DV during each turn in which you are wearing armor that has a heat point.
Reduce your armor's heat points by 1 per turn that it is not exposed to fire.

### Suffocating

Most creatures need to breath; being unable to breath can be rapidly fatal.
