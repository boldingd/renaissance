title: "Innate Abilities: Senses, Movements and Special Abilities"
---

The following are common Senses, Movement types and Special Abilities.
This list is by no means exhaustive.

## Senses

- Normal: the normal senses that humans have

- Blind-Sight: you have the ability to sense your surroundings, even when you cannot see; this might be a result of the heightening of your other sense, it might be a mechanism like a bat’s sonar, or it might be a magical ability.
  Even in conditions of total darkness, you can perceive your environment, including any object larger than a human fist, out to a distance of 30m.
  You cannot perceive color or fine detail.
  Perception tests made with Blind-Sight suffer a -20 penalty.

- Infra-red: you can see in infra-red.
  - This has several advantages:
    - you have a limited ability to see at night,
    - you can easily pick out objects at a very different temperature than their environment (like very hot objects in a cold room, or very cold objects in a hot room), and
    - you can very clearly see changes in blood-flow and skin temperature, which makes it easy to pick up on emotional queues that are invisible to many other races (which is represented as a +20 to Read checks against warm-blooded races).
  - However, this does have some drawbacks:
    - The resolution of infrared vision is poor, making it impossible to pick out fine detail.
    - Some materials (like glass) that are transparent in visible light are opaque in infrared, while some other materials that are opaque in visible light are transparent in infrared.

- Low-Light: creature can see clearly in low-light conditions (but not total darkness).
  - Essentially, this negates penalties for low light levels (like late evening), and reduces for penalties for near-darkness (like a moon-lit night).

- Mage-Sight: you can perceive magical energy.
  - This works much like normal vision, where magic appear much like a luminous substance.
    - The more magic is being gathered, the more obvious it is; a *power* might be as visible to someone with mage-sight as a camp-fire is to everyone else, while larger, more powerful spells might be shine like brilliant signal-fires, or stir up currents of magic that reach of hundreds of paces (making them obvious even at great distance).
    - But note that many *inert* substances are opaque to mage-sight, much like they are to visible light—that is, essentially, mage sight can't see through brick walls.
  - This has many effects:
    - A character with *Mage Sight* can clearly see powers, spells, and other magical effects.
    - This allows them to *analyse* a magical effect simply by *examining* it; this is a 10 minutes *Task Action* and requires a successful *Spellcraft* or *Knowledge: Magic* check.
    - Creatures with the *supernatural* have incorporated magical energy into their life-processes; this magical energy can be perceived with *Mage Sight*, making it obvious that those creatures are partly magical.
    - Spirits (creatures with the *Spirit* tag) are beings of magic, and thus are plainly evident when viewed with Mage Sight.
      However, their nature may appear strange, chaotic, or confusing—powerful spirits especially may be entirely overwhelming or incomprehensible.
  - Some rare creatures and powers can partially mask their magical nature; in these cases, an *opposed test* is required to detect the creature or power's magical nature (the details of this test will be specified by the creature or power's description).

- Motion: you have a particularly good sense for balance and motion.
  - This provides you with a +10 bonus to many Athletics checks, and may be useful in other circumstances as well.
  - This sense is very common in races with whiskers.

- Scent: you have an extremely keen sense of smell.
  - This allows you to reliably detect many creatures despite their best efforts at stealth, and to identify many substances by smell alone.
  - However, it does have some drawbacks: scent is not precise as to location, and it would be difficult or (practically) impossible to place an attack (for example) at range by scent alone.
  - Also, powerful odors may overwhelm a character with scent; in the most harmless case, this might make it difficult to detect other scents, but in the worst case, it might stun, disorient, or even incapacitate the character (like a blinding flash or deafening boom might incapacitate any other character).
  - Finally, particularly clever hunters may deliberately mask their scent.

- Vibration: when in contact with a solid object, you can sense vibrations propagating through it.
  - This allows you to sense approaching footfalls through the ground, for example.

## Movement Modes

General Rules:

  - Creatures have several different movement modes.

  - Most movement modes list *walking* and *running* rates
    
      - see *Combat* for rules about movement rates in combat.

  - Some movement modes also list a *maximum speed*, which is the
    maximum speed allowed for that movement mode.
    
      - We don’t have detailed rules for acceleration; as a rough guide,
        for movement modes with a maximum speed, you can add either your
        Walking or Running rate to your current speed in any given turn.

  - Most movement modes have a *linked skill*, which is used for tests
    regarding that movement mode. Tests are usually called for when
    difficult maneuvers are made (such as running across a slick
    surface), when attempting to *sprint* (see *Combat*) or as opposed
    tests during *chase scenes*.
    
      - Most movement modes, including Walking movement, use the
        Athletics skill.
      - Flying movement use the Flying skill.
      - Mounted movement uses the Riding skill.
      - Other movements mode, such as Burrowing movement, use the Exotic
        Movement skill.

Movement Modes:

  - Burrowing: you can burrow through the ground. You can choose to
    leave a tunnel behind you or not. Some soil, such as hard or rocky
    soil, cannot be burrowed through. If you have Burrowing as a
    movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while burrowing.
    
      - Linked to Exotic Movement: Burrowing

  - Climbing: you can climb as easily as humans can walk. Note that some
    creatures can’t climb some surfaces (someone that climbs with claws,
    like a cat, cannot climb on glass or metal, for example).
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

  - Flying: you can fly.
    
      - Linked to the Flying skill.

  - Leaping: you move in a series of hops, like a kangaroo or frog.
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.
      - Less hindered by broken group or small gaps

  - Swimming: you can swim as easily as humans can walk. If you have a
    Swim movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while underwater
    (presuming you need to breathe).
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

  - Walking: bipedal movement.
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

## Abilities

- Fast Healing: when you have Fast Healing *k*, you reduce your Damage by *k* each turn—normally healing by 20×*k* a minute.
  Every day, you may recover from one wound (what it might look like half-way through this process is best not thought about).
- Motion-Sensitive: your senses are particularly sensitive to motion.
  You receive a +10 bonus to Perception checks made against moving targets.

## Sizes

- The affects of being a different size are generally not represented mechanically (i.e. there is no “size modifier table”).
- Being *small* or *large* might confer bonuses in some situations, such as making it easier (if small) or harder (if large) to use Stealth; these are at the GM’s discretion.
- See also *Sizes* in *Combat*.
