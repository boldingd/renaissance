## Organizations

There are many organizations active in the Commonwealth, the wider Emerald Plane, and beyond.

Players should not feel like their characters need to *belong to* a particular organization, and GMs should not feel like these organizations need to play a prominent role in the adventures they build.
Nevertheless, they can be useful: membership in an organization can explain why a player-character is undertaking a particular adventure, and can give them appropriate resources to call on; likewise, these organizations can make good *quest-givers*—good sources of adventure.

## The Far-Watch

The Far Watch keeps watch over the affairs of spirits, magical creatures, mages, alchemists, and other powerful, unpredictable sources of danger; their task is a difficult one, because their resources are limited, and their opponents are both powerful and unpredictable.

### The Formation of the Far Watch

The Far Watch as such was formed only three years ago, when several independent organizations merged (and a few individual actors agreed to pool their resources).
Prior to that, there was a hodge-podge of organizations, temples, libraries and individuals, each dedicated to patrolling one particular "great threat".
This was highly inefficient; each organization often competed for the same resources, and drew from the same pool of talent.
Even worse, some organizations could be very poorly-funded—and sometimes multiple organizations with the same agenda could find themselves competing with one-another, or hedging one-another out of territory.

In CY 824, the leaders of the Mage-Watch and the Wheat-Way Guard began to cooperate to better organize their efforts; over the following year and a half, more organizations (and a few prominant individual actors) where recruited.
In CY 826, the group began to draft the charter for one combined organization, the Far Watch; it was approved the following year.
The organization is still recruiting, attempting to bring more of the disparate web of organizations, patrons and vigilantes under their aegis.

### Structure of the Far Watch

The Far-Watch is organized into *Watches*, which in turn are either *Vigils* and *Guards*.
A *Vigil* is devoted to a specific threat or task; they often correspond to one of the organizations that combined to form the Far-Watch.
A *Guard* is a specific holding of the Far-Watch—an office, outpost, fortress, manor or monastery.
Many *Guards* as such are new; when the Far-Watch was formed, the joining organizations where expected to surrender some of their holds to the Far-Watch for the formations of Guards.
(Unsurprisingly, this expectations has sometimes been a sticking-point in recruiting.)

The Far-Watch has little central command or governance; it has a Council, which is expected to meet every three years, and a Treasury, which collects and disburses resources.
There is no capitol for the Far-Watch; the Council's meeting-place will rotate, and is to be selected at the close of each Council meeting.
Each Watch sends one representative to this Council, and each representative is allowed one vote.

Mostly, the Council is expected to oversee the disbursement of resources and manage disputes; for the most part, each Watch is allowed to pursue their own ends—subject to the requirement that they share resources and support one-another, according to the charter of the Far-Watch.

One major concern is that the Far-Watch will be hobbled by internal politics, as the different Watches pursue their own ends, much like the organizations that spawned them.
The hope is that the Guards will counter this, since the Guards, in theory, should represent the interests of the whole of the Far-Watch within a region, as opposed to the narrow interests of one particular Vigil or another.
The hope is that, as the Far-Watch grows and expands, new Guards will be formed much more frequently than new Vigils, and that patronages will shift from the organizations that joined to form the Far-Watch—in the form of the Vigils—to the Far-Watch itself.

### Watches

#### The Wheat Vigil

The Wheat Vigil is devoted to policing contracts with Spirits, particularly those made by manors, land-holders and governments; it was formed from the Wheat-Way Guard.

The Wheat-Way Guard was formed after a disastrous contract with a Great Spirit resulted in the fall of the city of Wetwheel CY 796.
Wetwheel was a city of more than twenty thousand in Heartland Province; built where the Wheat Road crossed the Wheat River, it was named for a large water-wheel used to grind grain.
The city fell when a prominent citizen brokered a deal between a Great Spirit and the city; the spirit deceived them, their binds did not hold it, and it destroyed the city.
Little more than a hundred people are known to have survived Wetwheel.

The Wheat-Way Watch attempts to prevent such a tragedy from every happening again.
They do this in a number of ways; perhaps the most benign is by offering the services of priests and scholars in their ranks to governments brokering deals with Spirits, to attempt to prevent such a disastrous deal from being struck.
They are not, however, above the use of darker and more direct means to prevent the powerful from striking deals with Spirits that could prove to be disastrous; it is whispered that they have resorted to blackmail, intimidation, and even assassination in the name of preventing catastrophies like Wetwheel.

Unsurprisingly, they have no shortage of powerful enemies.

#### Redstone Hold

Redstone Hold is the largest Guard, and it was the first one to be established entirely from new resources (rather than being built from the holdings of a previous organization).
It was founded when the charter to a manor two *demarc* from Stormsword's Rest was granted to the Far-Watch by the Lord Durandel.

Redstone Hold itself is still under construction, but it already represents an important cite for the Far Watch; though meager, the taxes collected by the Hold from the residents of the manor represent a vital, independEnt source of resources for the Far-Watch—one that they do not have to wrest from the control of a Vigil.
The Far-Watch has put considerable effort into building up the library at the hold, and to ensuring that the site has the resources that scholars of spirits, magic and alchemy will need; they have also used endowments to lure scholars, artisans and scribes to the hold, and to the nearby town.
