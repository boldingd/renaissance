## Organizations

There are many organizations active in the Commonwealth, the wider Emerald Plane, and beyond.

Players should not feel like their characters need to *belong to* a particular organization, and GMs should not feel like these organizations need to play a prominent role in the adventures they build.
Nevertheless, they can be useful: membership in an organization can explain why a player-character is undertaking a particular adventure, and can give them appropriate resources to call on; likewise, these organizations can make good *quest-givers*—good sources of adventure.

## The Far-Watch

The Far Watch keeps watch over the affairs of spirits, magical creatures, mages, alchemists, and other powerful, unpredictable sources of danger; as their name implies, they also look to the horizon and the future, keeping an eye out for new threats beyond the understanding of the citizens of Commonwealth today.
Their task is a difficult one, because their resources are limited, and their opponents are both powerful and unpredictable.

### The Formation of the Far Watch

The Far Watch as such was formed only three years ago, when several independent organizations merged (and a few individual actors agreed to pool their resources).
Prior to that, there was a hodge-podge of organizations, temples, libraries and individuals, each dedicated to patrolling one particular "great threat".

This was inefficient and ineffective.
Most of those organizations where poorly funded, as they where often made up of academics, activists and fanatics, pursuing agendas that wider society did not take seriously.
Worse, they where often competing for the same resources and recruiting from the same pool of talent; this often meant that organizations with very similar goals could end up starving each-other for resources or pushing each-other out of territory.

In CY 824, the leaders of the Mage-Watch and the Wheat-Way Guard agreed to cooperate with one another, by sharing resources and aiding one-another's operatives.
Over the following year and a half, the arrangement was extended to more "Great Threat" organizations, and to a few individual actors.
In CY 826, the group began to draft the charter for one combined organization, the Far Watch; it was approved the following year.
The organization is still recruiting, attempting to bring more of the disparate web of organizations, patrons and vigilantes under their aegis.

### Structure of the Far Watch

The Far-Watch is organized into *Watches*, which in turn are either *Vigils* and *Guards*.
A *Vigil* is devoted to a specific threat or task; they often correspond to one of the organizations that combined to form the Far-Watch.
A *Guard* is a specific holding of the Far-Watch—an office, outpost, fortress, manor or monastery.
At present, there are few Guards, and they are relatively new; when an organization joins the Far-Watch, they are expected to surrender some of their holdings to form (or contribute to) an independent Guard.
(Unsurprisingly, this has sometimes been a sticking-point in recruiting.)

The Far-Watch has little central command or governance; it has a Council, which is expected to meet every three years, and a Treasury, which collects and disburses resources.
There is no capitol for the Far-Watch; the Council's meeting-place will rotate, and is to be selected at the close of each Council meeting (the second meeting of the Council has not yet occurred, since the Far-Watch is less than three years old).
Each Watch sends one representative to this Council, and each representative is allowed one vote.

Mostly, the Council is expected to oversee the disbursement of resources and manage disputes; for the most part, each Watch is allowed to pursue their own ends—subject to the requirement that they share resources and support one-another, according to the charter of the Far-Watch.

Some are concerned that the Far-Watch may be hobbled by internal politics as the different Watches battle for resources.
The hope is that the Guards will counter this, since the Guards, in theory, should represent the interests of the whole of the Far-Watch within a region—as opposed to the narrow interests of one particular Vigil.
The hope is that, as the Far-Watch grows and expands, new Guards will be formed much more frequently than new Vigils, and that patronages will shift from  the Vigils individually to the Far-Watch as a whole.

### Watches

#### The Wheat Vigil

The Wheat Vigil is devoted to policing contracts with Spirits, particularly those made by manors, land-holders and governments; it was formed from the Wheat-Way Guard.

The Wheat-Way Guard was formed after a disastrous contract with a Great Spirit resulted in the fall of the city of Wetwheel CY 796.
Wetwheel was a city of more than twenty thousand in Heartland Province; built where the Wheat Road crossed the Wheat River, it was named for a large water-wheel used to grind grain.
The city fell when a prominent citizen brokered a deal between a Great Spirit and the city; the spirit deceived them, their binds did not hold it, and it destroyed the city.
Little more than a hundred people are known to have survived Wetwheel.

The Wheat-Way Watch attempts to prevent such a tragedy from every happening again.
They do this in a number of ways; perhaps the most benign is by offering the services of priests and scholars in their ranks to governments brokering deals with Spirits, to attempt to prevent such a disastrous deal from being struck.
They are not, however, above the use of darker and more direct means to prevent the powerful from striking deals with Spirits that could prove to be disastrous; it is whispered that they have resorted to blackmail, intimidation, and even assassination in the name of preventing catastrophies like Wetwheel.

Unsurprisingly, they have no shortage of powerful enemies.

#### Redstone Hold

Redstone Hold is the largest Guard, and it was the first one to be established entirely from new resources (rather than being built from the holdings of a previous organization).
It was founded when the charter to a manor two *demarc* from Stormsword's Rest was granted to the Far-Watch by the Lord Durandel.

Redstone Hold itself is still under construction, but it already represents an important cite for the Far Watch; though meager, the taxes collected by the Hold from the residents of the manor represent a vital, independEnt source of resources for the Far-Watch—one that is under the control of the Far-Watch itself, that they do not have to wrest from the control of a Vigil.

The Far-Watch has put considerable effort into building up the library at the hold, and to ensuring that the site has the resources that scholars of spirits, magic and alchemy will need; they have also used endowments to lure scholars, artisans and scribes to the hold, and to manor-town nearby.

### Far-Watch Characters

The Far-Watch is an interesting and challenging organization for a player to join.
One the plus side, the Far-Watch offers players access to highly skilled NPCs (powerful mages, skilled alchemists, and well-read scholars of the strange and arcane) and rare resources (well-stocked mage's shops, alchemists' laboratories, strange treasures and libraries full of arcane or forgotten knowledge).
On the down-side, though, they also present challenges: the Far-Watch has powerful enemies, even in the Commonwealth (in the form of nobles they've crossed, powerful cults who view them as their major enemy, and possibly even powerful Spirits whose agendas they've spoiled), and can suffer from poor resource availability (because their outposts are few, and, though they do have some wealthy patrons, they have many more projects and operatives than they have resources).

Consider joining the Far-Watch if you:

- Want to be a *Call of Cthulhu*—style *investigator* or an *Eclipse Phase*—style agent.
- Want to be a volunteer for a resource-strapped organization that will require you to improvise and do without.
- Want to have mages, scholars and artisans as peers.

### Far-Watch Campaigns

The Far-Watch is, unsurprisingly, inspired by *Firewall*, the presumptive player-faction from Eclipse Phase; they are designed to tell similar stories.

The Far-Watch investigates out-of-context problems, black-swan events, and strange, weird and powerful forces beyond the ken of mortal souls or lesser Spirits alike.
if you'd like your players to confront cosmic forces and out-of-context problems, the Far-Watch is a great quest-giver faction; similarly, if you'd like to adapt a Strugatsky brothers novel, Twilight Zone episode or Thomas Ligotti story into an adventure, then an agent of the Far-Watch with a "problem" is probably a good place to start.

#### Far-Watch Adventure: A Bad Deal

A small monastery in Heartland Province holds the title to a nearby manor; the residents there are worried that the monks may be striking a disastrous deal with unreliable spirits—a deal that might claim them as well.

Are the monks striking such a deal, or do the townsfolk suspect them for nothing?
How dangerous is the deal?
What kind of spirit are they dealing with?
How can the party stop them—or is it already too late?


#### Far-Watch Adventure: An Empty Town

A small, combined Kobold and Dwarven burrow in the Haven Isles has vanished; the city remains, but the people are gone.
The party must determine what happened, whether the residents of the burrow can be recovered, and if it poses a threat to the wider Commonwealth.

Where did they go?
Where they claimed by a spirit?
Abducted by Leapers?
Did they do it to themselves—where they experimenting with psionic or sorcerous power, and did the experiments backfire or work precisely as intended?

#### Far-Watch Adventure: A Strange Island

An explorer sailing west from the Haven Isles has found a deserted island with a long-abandoned village, built by a culture unknown.
At first, the village appeared almost normal, but, upon closer investigation, it was found to contain wondrous objects—like bronze plates that hovered away from each-other, rigidly fixed and immovable as though they where connected, or an iron trellise that, if touched, would cause any metal object to sprout tiny, branching tendrils of metal, eventually vanishing into a haze or iron filaments—where scattered among deadly hazards—like strange, shimmering patches of ground that would violently wrench the limbs of any who stepped on them, shattering bones and destroying limbs.
The explorers sold their discovery to the Far-Watch, who are the most qualified to plumb the secrets of the island, to determine if it could ever possibly be safely exploited—and whether or not it represents a glimpse of some greater threat that might some day come for the Commonwealth.

What happened to the island?
Did the residents of the city do this to themselves?
Did some calamity claim them?
Was the catastrophy deliberate, or was it an incidental result of some other agenda?
What treasures may lie deeper into the unexplored city?

## The High Road

The High Road is an anti-slavery organization that smuggles slaves to freedom.
The High Road is active throughout the known world; they smuggle slaves out of the Goblin Empire, the Shaded Sea and the Kingdoms of Men, to freedom in the Commonwealth and Raptor's Protectorate.

In the Commonwealth, the 'Road operates relatively openly—especially in provinces far from the borders.
While they still keep their contacts and routes secret, and disguise who is and is not a slave being smuggled to freedom (and most certainly keep secret those slaves' real identities), members of the High Road in the Commonwealth may make their loyalty to the 'Road known.

Agents of the High Road operating inside the Shaded Sea or the Goblin Empire are in a far more dangerous position.
Often, these are not Commonwealth citizens, but natives to the Shaded Sea or Goblin Empire—Shade Elves, Ratfolk, Goblins and Gremlins who collaborate to smuggle their kin's slaves to freedom—those who too quickly believe that all Shade Elves or Goblins are evil should consider that most of the members of the High Road are Shade Elves and Goblins.

### Overview

The High Road operates relatively openly in the Commonwealth.
They public supports them, and they enjoy the patronage of wealthy citizens and organization.

They still have to keep their operations secret; even in the Commonwealth, operatives of slave-holders will investigate the High Road and its operatives, seeking to track their operations and recover their "property".
(Or, worse, to slay its members and foil their operations.)

Operatives in slave-holding nations must be far more secretive.
They are extremely careful to protect their operations, both for their own sake, and because there are precious few reliable paths to smuggle slaves to safety from deep within the Shaded Sea, the Goblin Empire's holdings on the Ruby Plane, or the Eastern Kingdoms.
They are often organized into cells, knowing only the previous links in the chain, or the few that follow them.

### High-Road Characters

The High-Road can be a very morally satisfying faction to join—who doesn't love underdog heroes smuggling slaves to freedom?
They can also be incredibly high-stakes; a High-Road character will be in incredibly danger outside of the Commonwealth, and even *within* the Commonwealth, an enemy could still appear, swooping out of the darkness to capture or kill the character.
