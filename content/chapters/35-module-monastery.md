title: "Sample Module: A Crisis in Northland"
---

## Introduction

This is a small sample module.
It is based on the very first game that was used to test *Rensaissance*, and it's a good example of *horror* game, in the "tales-of-the-weird" sense.

## Player Prompt

A ferocious blizzard has descended on the *Hella Valley*; almost a white-out, it has trapped the people of valley in their homes and brought life in the valley to a standstill.

For whatever reason, you are in *Southlander's Market*, a small city inhabited mostly by Humans and Ratfolk in the south of valley.
As the name implies, *Southlander's Market* is something of a trade-hub for the valley; it sits on Hella High-Road, a nominal highway that runs out of the valley to the east, leading to the Tol Confederacy more than fifteen *demarc* away, and eventually to the rest of the Commonwealth.

The city shares the valley with the *Weaver's Hold*, a Dwarven hold known for their wools; *Forge-and-Hearth Burrow*, a Kobold burrow that hosts the valley's most skilled smiths; the centuries-old *Whitefox Monastery*; and a number of smaller Human and Gnollish hamlets.

The situation in *Southlander's Market* is slowly deteriorating.
No contact has been had with Weaver's Hold, Forge-and-Hearth Burrow or—most alarmingly—Whitefox Monastery for days—much less anyone travelling up the highway from the wider Commonwealth.
While the village is well-enough stocked for the week ahead at least, if the blizzard does not break, the city may begin to succumb to hunger and cold.

Many in the town believe that someone should make the trek to the monastery to see if there's anything that they can do.
Landlord Ceder-Inn, the Ratfolk who runs the Ceder Inn in *Southlander's Market*, has decided to take matters into his own hands, and is trying to arrange a party to make the trip.

## Overview

## Starting Out

The adventure starts out in the Ceder Inn in *Southlander's Market*.
Like many *intrigue* and *horror* games, the first part of the module will consist of *preparation* and *investigation*—that is, after character introductions have been made, and the player-characters have accepted the *quest*.

They likely won't spend *much* time in *Southlander's Market*.
There aren't any particular clues here; no-one in town knows what's happening and why (other than the *Traitor*), so asking about, though a wise precaution, won't be particularly fruitful.

The major risk is that they'll find the *Traitor Monk* (see below)—that is, if you're using the *Traitor Monk* and you've put them in the town.
Obviously, you'll want to keep the party from discovering the traitor if encountering them early can end the adventure; successes on investigation might yield hints about *suspicious travelers*, but you should avoid clues that might lead the party directly to the traitor.

### Location: Hella Valley

Hella Valley is named after the *Hella*, the name given to the Humans and Dwarves that live in the region, and their (partly) shared culture.

The valley funs from east to west; the Worldspine Mountains rise to the west, and, even though the peaks are far to the south, they are still a formidable natural barrier—expecially given the cold.

The valley is well forrested, and the Hella River runs through it.
The valley is dotted with small farming towns, and it also sees logging, trapping and fishing.
The river usually swells during the spring thaw, but all the cities and towns are built far enough from it to be out of danger.

### Location: Southlander's Market

*Southlander's Market* is a small town of little more than one-and-a-half thousand people, mostly Humans and Ratfolk.
The town is built around the *Hella High-Road*, which runs to *Weaver's Hold* higher in the Worldspine Mountains to the southweast, and out of the valley to the east.
As the name implies, it's the region's major market; what travellers that come usually do so by taking the road into the valley, and folk from the 'Hold, the 'Burrow, and the various hamlets in the region come to the market in *Southerlander's Market* to sell their wares.

The town combines Dwarven, Human and Ratolk influences in its design.
The town is roughly rectangular in design, running from east to west with the road; it's 9 blocks *east to west*, and only five blocks *north to south*.
It's surrounded by a wall, but it hasn't been well-maintained; it's been a long time since raiders came here.

Most of the buildings are constructed of timber—corner-joined, with the logs cut square, some faced with planks or plaster, some not.
A few of the nicer buildings are build of brick.
Most have thick, thatched rooves.

The valley isn't far enough north that the ground is permafrost—it thaws in springs.
A number of the buildings incorporate dug-out portions.

The city isn't wealthy; many of the people there are farmers and trappers.

### Location: Forge-and-Hearth Burrow

Forge-and-Hearth Burrow is a small Kobold burrow that sits three *demarc* northeast of Southlander's Market.
The population is less than 500.
It consists of a large, central burrow, surrounded by a number of smaller single-family burrows and surface structures—some of the surface structures are older than the burrow itself, built by the first Kobold settlers more than 200 years ago before they had dug the burrow.

Forge-and-Hearth is well-named; it's occupants are miners, fishers and trappers, and the burrow is known for its iron, fish and food.

### Location: The Market

### Location: The Ceder Inn

The Ceder Inn is located thirty paces outside the city wall, situated on the road into town.
It consists of several buildings, all of timber constructions and painted bright red.
The largest buildings are the main building and the barn; there is also a separate house for the Ceder-Inn family, a stables, a shed and a sauna.
The stables and inn are next to the road, with the sauna, shed, family-house and barn being behind them.
A *covered path* connects all of them; it is dug half a *stride* into the ground, and has log walls and a thatch roof.

The *sauna* is a small, circular building with brick walls.

The main inn consists of a large, central common-room, with a large stone hearth in the center.
Some people sleep in the common-room, but there are also private rooms along one wall.
(Some guests even choose to sleep in the lofts above the barn and stables.)
The kitchen is an open structure accessed through the back; three walls are timber, but one wall is open, to allow the kitchen to ventilate in the summer.
In winter, the kitchen's fourth wall is blocked with a large wool cover.

The Ceder Inn is where the "quest-giver", Landlord Ceder-Inn, lives, so it's where the adventure is likely to start.
Any PCs that aren't from the area may also be staying at the Ceder Inn.
The inn mostly sells food; if the PCs need anything more than rations, they'll need to travel to the *market* to equip.

### Character: Landlord Ceder-Inn

### Minor Character: Rust-Fur

Rust-Fur is the Gnollish commander of the local Commonwealth guard; he's a male Gnoll in his early thirties, and he lives and operates out of Southlander's Market.
He's respected by the locals as a leader and probably-solver.
While he doesn't know anything about the magical blizzard, his knowledge of the area might be useful—although it will be difficult for the party to convince him to abandon his post to travel to the monastery.

Rust-Furr might be useful if the party doesn't have anyone with good ranks in Survival; he can lead them to the monastery—or assign a Guard to the task.

Rust-Furr would also make a decent PC, if there's a player in the group struggling to come up with a good idea.

### Minor Character: "Prince" South-Vintner

Named South-Vintner in Common but dubbed "the prince" by the city-folk, South-Vintner is the mayor of the Southlander's Market.
The young scion of a wealthy family further south, it's widely (and correctly) held that it's more wealth than competence that got him his office.
Even so, he isn't a bad person; he's honest, hard-working and insightful—even if isn't perhaps a natural leader.
He's working hard to prove himself.

South-Vintner can provide the party with resources and support.
If the party needs resources they can't afford, they might be able to convince South-Vintner to bankroll them.
South-Vintner can also secure the cooperation of professionals in the town, from blacksmiths to doctors.

### Minor Character: Ambition

One Kobold matriarch, named *Ambition* in Common, wants to start producing high-quality steel in Forge-and-Hearth.
She's been trying to form a closer partnership with the human smiths of *Southlander's Market*—including apprenticing some of her more talented children in the 'Market.

### Encounter: Negotiating

### Encounter: Equipping the Party

## The Trip

[[designnote]]
| Remember that a *demarc* (*dc*) is about 2.6 miles or about 4.2 kilometers, and *stride* (*sd*) is about 30 inches or 75 cm.

Whitefox Monastery is only about 4dc away from Southlander's Market; where it not for the blizzard, it would not be a particularly difficult journey, even in winter.
The blizzard, however, complicates things.

The thick snow and near-whiteout conditions will dramatically slow the party's pace; the *base pace* in the blizzard will be only 2dc-per-day (see *Travel*).
Additionally, navigation will be particularly difficult; the party will need to make a *Survival* check to navigate, and that check will have a -30 penalty.
Foraging for food (see *Travel*) will be exceptinally difficult, and will also suffer a -30 penalty.

Making camp will also be difficult; unlike normal, the party will need to make a *Survival* check to assemble a camp that will allow them to survive the extreme cold.
(Characters can mitigate this by finding a cave or other natural feature to shelter in, but this will require a *Search* or *Survival* check at -20.)

The cold will be a significant hazard; each member of the party will need to make a *Feat of Endurance* test at the end of every day they spend in the snow.
(If they choose to keep traveling at night instead of making camp, have them make a second *Feat of Endurance* check for the night.)
Each time a character fails a *Feat of Endurance* check, they suffer 1d10DV (this damage has the *Cold* and *Environmental* tags; resistances and other features may apply).
