title: "Building Characters"
---

So, we've laid out several rules and "systems," we've provided lists of skills, powers, classes, traits and items, and we've talked about the 5 Roles.
After reading all of this, you still might be wondering how all these pieces fit together to build a *character*.

Here, we're going to break that down a little, talking about how to build a character for each of the roles, and what you should know to play them.

## Combatant: winning (or just surviving) combat encounters

> Smoothly and quickly, the shifter changed: in a few seconds, the structure of her legs and skull changed, like blown-glass flowing, fur billowed out from her as smoke from fire, and large, sickle-like claws descended from her hands.
> She snarled at Chandra ferociously, giving challenge.
>
> Then the General's bronze fist slammed into her jaw with sharp, audible crack, like a blacksmith shattering a ceramic mold with a sledge; the general had begun his charge before he broke from the cover of the forrest, and had never broken stride.
> She collapsed back like a statue shoved over from the top and lay still on the ground.
>
> The slaver-camps' other guards sprang into action, bringing spears to bear against him, but it was much too late.
> Even as one guard drove a spear into the General, ripping flesh and scale from one of his ribs, Chandra's allies attacked.
> Aryn fired an arrow from the treeline, striking one square in the chest; Venn charged in behind the general, skewering another guard with the tip of her halberd.
>
> Chandra turned in fury on the guard that had wounded him; he struck a ferocious blow with the pommel of his sword, knocking loose a chunk of the bony plate that protected the guard's head and sprawling the stunned Goblin on the ground.

> Chandra hauled himself up to the soldier standing watch at the fort's gate.
> "I am General Chandra," he said—and it was by no means certain that the guard would recognize and believe him, covered in bleeding wounds, bandages and splints as he was, and out of uniform.
> "I and my companions liberated a slave-camp three *demarc* over the border; they are encamped ten *demarc* southeast from here, on the other side of the river, waiting for help to ferry the slaves across.
> You are to organize a patrol, secure boats, and see them safely here."
>
> The soldier considered him for a moment, unsure; then she saluted and hurried off into the fort.
>
> Chandra looked at the other soldier; he saluted as well.
> The general then began to stagger to the infirmary, where he suspected he would spend at least the next several days.

## Analyst: figure out what's going on

> Very carefully, Fire used the small putty-knife to scoop out a glob of the dark ichor that had oozed from the creature's skull; he scraped it off into a clay jar and closed it with its waxed lid.
> He picked up the sealed jar and walked over to a small iron kettle that he'd brought to a boil at the foot of the bon-fire Aryn had built; he dropped the sodden putty-knife in.
>
> "All right, throw it on," he said to her; she nodded to Chandra, and the two began to walk over to the corpse of the strange and disfigured crow-like creature that they'd slain.
> "Don't touch it."
>
> "We're not idiots, Fire," Chandra said, although not angrily; Fire, silently contemplating the sealed jar, did not notice.

*Renaissance* supports *intrigue*, *investigation* and *horror* as primary play modes, and characters who understand the subtle details of how their world works can be essential to succeeding (or just surviving) those kinds of adventures.
Knowing which Kingdom-of-Men a certain pendant belongs to, whether a magical effect is the work of *mortals* or *spirits*, or what kinds of creatures lurk in the deep underground can all turn the course of an adventure.

### Your Analyst's Concept

*Renaissance* has very diverse knowledge skills; from Art: Theater to Knowledge: Astronomy to Profession: Scholar, there's more out there than any one character could know.
This means that your *Analyst* character will have to pick a specific set of Knowledge skills to focus on, and will wind up being fairly specialized.
A first step is thinking about what you want your Analyst to know.
Are they a scholar of history and law, like River?
A master of magic and natural philosophy, like Fire?
A general well-versed in matters of war and politics, like General Chandra?
Or perhaps just a well-read, well-travelled, and inquisitive soul, like Notebook?

Of course, Profession is also a knowledge skill; that means that a professional artisan like Veil can also be an Analyst.

### Your Analyst's Build

If your character is **great at Analysis**:

- At least two Knowledge skills at 70.
  - These represent your Analyst's particular *expertise*.
  - Remember Art, Knowledge, Profession, and Protocol are all Knowledge skills.
- Research at at least 50.
- Either the *Scholar* class or the *Jack of All Trades* class.
  - The *Scholar* class is important so that your expert in military tactics can still be an *Analyst* during an adventure on an unexplored island 800 *demarc* from the coast.
  - The *Jack of All Trades* is important for profession-based Analysts; it allows your master Chemist to be able to provide at least basic information about farming practices or soldiery.
- 25 COG or more
  - This is important to get the highest TN you can for your knowledge skills, and to get the most out of the Scholar class.
  - Even if your Analyst is art-based, you'll still want ot have good COG, because COG is used for the *Scholar* class, for the *Research* skill, and to *Solve Logical Puzzles*.
- 20 INT or more
  - The *Jack-of-All-Trades* class uses a INT as well as COG.
  - INT is used to *Make a Guess*, *Get a Clue* and for *Difficult Uses of Language*.
  - And, of course, Art is INT-based; you'll need 25 or more INT if your Analyst is an artist.
- Optionally: the *Member* class
  - Are you faculty at a university somewhere?  Or or you a member of one of the Commonwealth's professional guilds?  Represent it with the *Member* class.
- Optionally: a *skill kit* or *shop*.
  - A *skill kit* might contain the tools specific to your area of expertise, while a *shop* might include a library, an office, quills, paper, or a space for tutoriing.
  - A Profession: Scholar skill kit is a workable way to "cheat" and get a flexible kit that includes "you know, probably papers, pens, and some reference books."
  - You should definitely take a *Skill Kit* or *Shop* if you don't take the *Member* class—because your character has to have their papers and notes *somewhere*, and if they're not a *Member* of a of some organization, they have to provide it themselves.
  - You might want to take a *Skill Kit* or *Shop* even if you *are* a *Member* of an organization, so that you aren't *dependant* on that organization for support—which is especially important if you're a *travelling* scholar who might find themselves far away from the college that they're a member of.
- Optionally: Profession: Scholar at 50 or more.
  - This is *in addition* to your two-or-more *other* knowledge skills at 70 or more.
  - Profession: Scholar is useful if your character makes their living as a scholar—by tutoring students, lecturing, conducting research, and corresponding with other scholars.

If your character is **good at Analysis**:

- At least two Knowledge skills at 50.
- *Research* at at least 50
  - *Research* might be even more important if we already know your character doesn't know *everything* about their particular expertise.
- Either the *Scholar* class or the *Jack of All Trades* class.
  - These classes remain important for the same reasons, but note that you'll need to take good enough COG and INT to use them.
  - If you don't take one of these classes, you might encounter a lot of situations where your group needs an analyst but you can't help.
- 20 COG or more
- 20 INT or more, if you're going to take *Jack of All Trades*

### Your Analyst's Combinations

Characters with high COG might be likely to take *Craft* and *Profession* skills, and serve the party as *provisioners* as well as *Analysts*.
It also makes sense that someone with Knowledge: Natural Philosophy might have a few ranks in Craft: Chemistry and Profession: Chemist, or that someone with lots of ranks in Knowledge: Military Tactics might have ranks in Profession: Soldier and Craft: Armorer.

Characters who want to emphasize the social aspects of scholarship—who might be faculty at a university, for example, or famous authors of textbooks and tracts—could also purchase ranks in social skills and serve the party as a secondary social character.
Protocol is an especially logical choice here.

Characters who really want to lean into a *Provisioner* role might also purchase a high Wealth score; this makes some sense, as scholars can be well paid—and because it's often the wealthy who can afford to become a scholar in the first place.

All of these ideas could be combined: an *Analyst* character with *Protocol* at 60, some social and craft skills in the 50's, and wealth at least 4 could be a powerful Provisioner as well as an analyst.

Of course, characters with good COG might also take Medicine and serve the party as a healer.

Or, going in a completely different direction, scholars of magic (or chemistry) can have access to the skills and resources to be quite deadly.

From world-wise benedictine monks to fastidious Belgian detectives, investigators can make great characters.
An Analyst character could also purchase ranks in *Search* and *Perception* to build an *investigator*.
The concept could be taken further bu purchasing ranks in other Infiltration-related skills.

There are two practical risks to this kind of detective character.
One is that it might be *too* atomic and self-contained—one of the Analyst's major external dependencies is the Infiltrator, who they depend on to provide them with clues and information.
If the Investigator and Analyst are the same person, they might vanish into a solipsistic adventure that barely involves the rest of the party.
Another is that it presents a significant risk if an infiltration fails and the character is captured (or killed): the party's "knowledge assets" will have fallen into enemy hands.

### The Analyst Role

As an analyst, your main job is to provide the party with information.

Over the course of an adventure, the party will have question.
"Could this strange phenomenon be the work of mortals, or is a spirit doing it?  What mortal mages are likely culprits?"
"What Spirits could be doing this?  What do they want?  How can we stop them?"
"Who would want to assassinate this Eastern King?  Does this scrap of cloth make one of those options more likely than the other?  Could it be a set-up?"
"Is that person a real blacksmith?  Where are they really from?  Where they ever in the army, or a guild?"
"Did this relic really come from a mysterious island far off the coast, or is it a fake?  How old is it?  What might it do?"

Your job, as an analyst, is to provide this kind of information, and your knowledge skills (and the *Scholar* and *Jack-of-all-Trades* classes) are the tools that you'll use to do this.

Sometimes, the GM will tell you things that you just *know*, without requiring you to explicitly ask a question or roll a check; we encourage GM's to assume that, if you have *basic competence* in a skill—that is, 10 ranks—that you have access to *common knowledge* associated with a specific Knowledge skill.

Other times, however, you'll need to *actively* ask the GM questions, and actively roll checks to find out what your character knows; always keep in mind that your character might know more about a given subject than the GM told you up-front.
The GM might not even tell you that you *can* roll a check or *might* know more; this means that you need to be fairly active.
Try to keep track of what bits of information the party has, and what other pieces of information that the party *needs*, and look for ways that you can answer those hanging questions.
(In investigation-themed games, parties can hang because they either don't have an analyst, or the analyst isn't actively tackling open questions and turning them into answers.)

Note that some of those questions are of the form, "and what can we do about it?"
That's a question that you can use your Knowledge skills to ask the GM!
Sometimes, especially when the group is stuck, you can ask the GM what avenues the party has open, or what pieces they might have missed.
If you're an analyst, you might have good INT; remember that you can always just *make a guess* or *get a hint* (see *Basic Rules*).

Of course, you shouldn't be overbearing.
Just because you have all the expertise, doesn't mean you get to be the boss.
Just because you have a plan you like, doesn't mean the rest of the party has to agree to it.
Just because you need some piece of information, doesn't mean someone else has to go get it for you.

#### Research and Experimentation

Being an analyst is likely to involve time in libraries, labs, and workshops.

### Your Analyst and Other Characters

Analysts need someone to provide them with clues and information to *analyse*: they depend on *Infiltrators* to get into interesting places and get out with interesting things; on *Socialites* to use their social skills to get information out of people; and on *Provisioners* to buy, bribe, or extort secrets and treasures that can't be acquired any other way.

Analysts also often need resources—access to libraries, workshops and laboratories.
They might depend on a *Provisioner* to get them these resources.

And, of course, once an *Analyst* has a strong hypothesis or workable plan, they might need a "doer" to carry it out; this might be an *Infiltrator* quietly stealing a hidden treasure or dispatching a troublesome noble, a *Socialite* running a smear campaign or blackmailing a noble, or—last, but by no means least—a *Combatant* sorting an enemy out.

> Fire began to chip at the wall of ice with a small, sharp hammer he'd produced form his smith's tools; Notebook turned, stepped over to her rucksack, retrieved several glass vials, heaters and other apparatuses and began to set them up.
> After a moment, she stopped, and listened closely; she could hear no sign of Fire.
> No chipping, no footsteps, no breathing in the echoing caverns.
>
> "Fire?" she asked; there was no response.
> "*Fire*?" she asked again, fear creeping into her voice; again, there was no response from Fire, only the distant echo of her own voice and breathing.
>
> She turned around; Fire was looking at her, confused.
> "Yes?  Couldn't you hear me?" he asked.
>
> "No," she said, still slightly rattled.
> "…didn't you get a sample?" she asked after a moment.
>
> He looked down at his hands: he was holding the pick and an empty jar.
> He then looked back at the wall: it was barely scratched.
> He'd made no progress at all in the intervening minutes.
>
> "No," he said, more curious than frightened—if only slightly.
>
> "Fascinating," said Notebook.

## Socialite: bullying, bluffing, lying, flattering and persuading

## Infiltrator: getting into interesting places, getting out with interesting things

## Provisioner: getting the party what they need

## Survivalist: getting by in the wild

## Healer: putting the party back together
