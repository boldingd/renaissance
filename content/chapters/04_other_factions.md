## <span id="anchor-17"></span>The Kingdoms of Men

  - The Kingdoms of Men are an unstable feudal society to the east of
    the Commonwealth; it arose from the human populations there more
    than a hundred years after the Empire collapsed.

  - They are Kingdoms in more than name alone; the society consists of a
    large number of local nobles, tied together in a complex web of
    allegiances.
    
      - Many of these alliances are fragile; they can shift, form and
        break quickly.
      - The politics of the Kingdoms can be incredibly treacherous, with
        different power block constantly jostling for control.

  - Only sometimes can one King credibly claim rulership over all (or
    most) of the Kingdoms—and even then, such a High King’s rule is
    often tenuous.
    
      - There first High Kingship lasted from CY 255 to CY 281; this
        short-lived dynasty collapsed 10 years after passing form its
        founder to its first heir, rent apart by an internal power
        struggle.
      - The second High Kingship lasted from CY 361 to CY 435. These
        High Kings were substantially more warlike, and were at constant
        conflict with both the Dragonshire to their east and the Goblin
        Kings to their South. The Kingship collapsed after a series of
        disastrous military adventures between CY 429-CY 433.
      - The third High Kingship began in CY 695, and has lasted to the
        present day. This High Kingship has had good relations first
        with the Dragonshire, and now with the Commonwealth.

  - The Kingdoms can be roughly divided between their Western and
    Eastern halves.
    
      - The western Kingdoms are relatively open; they have benefited
        heavily from trade with the Commonwealth, and have little
        interest in conflict with their wealthy and powerful neighbor.
      - The present High King hails from a city-state in the western
        kingdoms, and has supported the Kingdom’s alliance with the
        Commonwealth.
      - The eastern Kingdoms are far more cruel; they contain the
        original Three Cities that built the Empire, and to this day
        they are quick to believe that humans should hold dominion over
        other species, and that they should hold dominion over humans..

  - The Kingdoms are military overmatched by the Commonwealth, and so
    they have been in a somewhat uneasy state of peace for than 150
    years.

## <span id="anchor-18"></span>The Shaded Sea People

  - Alliance of Ratfolk and Shade Elves.
  - Shade elves originate in the Southwestern corner of the Emerald
    Plane, where they were a fearsome mounted raiding people.
  - Ratfolk originate in an island chain 300km off the coast, where they
    where skilled sailors.
  - Complex history of raiding and violence.
  - Both Shade Elves and then Ratfolk where forced to pay tribute by a
    third, rarely-encountered people, the Leapers.
  - They raided each-other to meet the tribute demands, until some 400
    years ago, when they instead allied with each other and turned to
    raiding the Commonwealth.
  - Their siege of Islandholme in CY 447 is a major turning point; their
    devastating defeat depletes the resources of the houses that mounted
    the attack.
  - They turned to raiding the Ratfolk who had settled on the Raptor’s
    Plane, fleeing their cruel cousins; this ended when they allied with
    the Raptors, and eventually ejected the Shaded Sea Peoples from
    Raptor’s Plane.
  - At present, they are still an active piratical and raiding culture,
    and they still have several “client” populations in the Shaded Sea
    and on Emerald Plane.

## <span id="anchor-19"></span>The Raptor’s Alliance

  - The Raptor’s Alliance
  - On the Raptor’s Plane, in the North-West and Central regions of the
    continent.
  - An alliance formed almost 400 years ago to resist piracy and raiding
    by Shaded Sea People.
  - United the Raptors with Ratfolk who had settled on the North-West
    shore, fleeing the cruelty of their cousins.
  - First contacted 300 years ago, with heavy travel beginning 200 years
    ago.
  - Friendly with the Commonwealth, though independent.
  - May be forced into closer alliance, as they are pressured by Goblins
    on the Eastern shore and Shaded Sea peoples on the West.

## <span id="anchor-20"></span>The Goblin Kings

  - In South-East of Emerald Plain – East of Dragonshire, South of
    Kingdoms of Men
  - also on North-Eastern edge of the Raptor’s Plane.
  - In the past, they were a much bigger threat; the Commonwealth and
    Kingdoms have since grown militarily too powerful, and the Goblinoid
    Kingdoms have been “contained.”
  - Rather than die out, they’ve crossed the Gulf and begun colonizing
    the island-continent to the South.
  - There they have subjugated several of the races they’ve encountered,
    and have begun to become wealthy.

## <span id="anchor-21"></span>The Commonwealth’s Nightmare

  - Between these four powers, the Commonwealth has two allies and three
    enemies.
    
      - The Commonwealth can handily defeat any one of them, and could
        possibly defeat two of them; however, should all three form an
        alliance, the Commonwealth would be defeated.
      - The Commonwealth has invested heavily in helping to ensure that
        rule of the Kingdoms of Men does not fall to a noble from the
        eastern Kingdoms.
      - The Commonwealth has also fought to ensure that the Goblin Kings
        can find no allies among the human Kingdoms.
      - The Shaded Sea People, at least, seem unlikely to ally with any
        of the other great powers soon; the Leapers show little interest
        in forming alliances, and they do not seem likely to subjugate
        either the human or goblin kingdoms far to the East in the
        foreseeable future.
