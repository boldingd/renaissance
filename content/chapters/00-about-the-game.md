title: "About the Game"

This is an early alpha of an open-source fantasy RPG.

This is probably going to be a maximum complexity release. People have
had a bunch of good ideas, and instead of haggling over a lot of them,
I’m just going to import all of them and see how that shakes out.
Right now, I think we have too many different systems, and I’d like to
slim it down some—but we’ll make that decision after we see how it
actually plays. (To name just a few, besides the stuff we inherited from
EP, we have a dot-based language system, a dot-based wealth system, a
milestone system and reputation system in the optional rules.)

This also applies to the combat system; we’ve mainlined the Maneuvers
section, complete with two new maneuvers; we’ve added mounted-combat and
unarmed-combat rules; we’ve got a pretty large and extensive weapons
rework; and we’ve now got a whole bunch of weapon and armor tags that Do
Things. None of these are bad things, but we’re starting to have a *lot*
of combat mechanics in a game that isn’t *supposed* to be
combat-focused, so some slimming and streamlining would be good.

Also note: there where a lot of strike-through or color-coded blocks that
didn't survive the conversion to markdown, so there will be some really
confusing text while we root all of that out.

Changes since last time:

- Added shields, woops.
- reformatting in Items and Wealth.
- Adding more asides in Items and Wealth.
- rewriting and expanding a bunch of race blocks.
  - Gnolls have a lot more text, and arctic gnolls are mentioned now.
  - Greatly expanding Dwarves (they were stubbed), adding CV's Mycenaean Dwarves idea.
- Added guidance about custom classes, items and powers.
- Added a few of CV's powers.
- Started reworking the wealth section.
- Started adding examples to the skills section.
- *Finished* reworking the wealth section!  Added Cash, added trade goods, removed barter.

Feedback Questions

  - So, milestones?

  - How’s the new wealth system?
    
      - It needs to allow Lady Alexis to throw money at problems easily,
        while also allowing fire to buy a night at an inn both simply
        and without going bankrupt.

  - How are the new Proficiency Skills?

  - How’s the weapons rework?

  - So, what can we remove? We’ve got a *lot *more different systems
    than I want, and I’d like some of them to go.

To-Do:

  - revise items-and-down for new attack skills.

  - Edit the example section to match the last like 3 revisions of changes, god.

  - Update the Ratfolk entry to flow a little more like the Elven one.

  - And update the Gnoll entry to include Arctic Gnolls.

  - Lots more player options\!
    
      - I did the classes and powers and backgrounds that where
        interesting to me, but I really need to do samples for others
        too.
      - More Items\! Especially more magical items\!

  - Change *Maneuvers* to maybe *Feats* as the name for martial powers.

  - Convert “walk” and “run” movement to “base” and “full”,
    respectively.

  - We need massive editing. I’ve been resisting, but it’s large enough
    that we can’t use it without some major clean-up.
    
      - If we’re gonna do that, we may as well get a website up and
        running.

  - Rework the intro sections.

  - Write a Sample Hazards section.

  - Update the “bestiary” part, since it’s two rules revisions out of
    date.
    
      - Also, tag the things in it with a difficulty hint.
      - And add Sinestro’s Cold Shadows and Sauce’s Whisps.

  - Get someone other than me to test indicate-only, touch-only and
    off-handed weapons, to make sure those snarls are tractable to GMs
    and players that didn’t write them.

Editing Notes:

  - I need to go through and use the term Tag consistently. And then also re-work most entries to use Tags.

  - Likewise, use “Check” consistently, as opposed to “Test”.

  - I’m trying to use “the character” or “a character” consistently, to
    emphasize that players and NPCs use the same rules. I need to go
    back and edit this to be the case.
    
      - Sometimes this results in tortured language, I might need to
        reevaluate.

  - I’m trying to use “they” in cases where gender is unknown or
    unspecified. I *really hate* the “pick an arbitrary gender” writing
    style that many d20 systems use.

  - I’d like to use lower-case for race names (“orc” and “elf” instead
    of “Orc” and “Elf.” I was using caps for a long while tho, so much
    editing will be required.)
      - I give up, I'm going back to caps-ing race names.

  - It’s spelled “orc” by the way.

  - At least for now, I’ve decided on just calling it *magic*. I wanted
    to use something a little fancier, like *essence*, but I couldn’t
    come up with something I wanted to commit to. I’m using the terms
    *mage* and *spell,* *psion* and *sleight*, and *priest* and *boon*.
    I may revisit this.
    
      - I’ve specifically avoided using “arcane” as a description,
        because it annoys me that a generation of grognards are growing
        up who think that that word means “knowledge magic” and don’t
        realize that it actually just means “difficult secret.”

  - Note: I need to use Emerald Plane, Raptor’s Plane and Worldspine
    Mountains consistently.

  - We use colored highlighting\! We put sidebars and clarifications in
    teal, FIXME notes in yellow, examples in purple, playtester
    questions in salmon, and GM Guidance in green.
    
      - There may not be enough difference between GM Guidance and most
        Sidebars to give them different colors.
      - Also, the two GM Guidance blocks so far are *really long*, so
        treating them like a sidebar might not work.

  - ... does anyone know of a gender-neutral replacement for words like "craftsman" and "Swordsman" that won't also result in tortured language?
