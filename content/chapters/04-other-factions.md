## <span id="anchor-17"></span>The Kingdoms of Men

The Kingdoms of Men are a human nation that lies to the northeast of the Dragonshire; it arose from the ashes of the Empire of Man more than a century after it had collapsed.

They are Kingdoms in more than name alone; the society consists of a
large number of local nobles, tied together in a complex web of
allegiances.  At present, there are 23 kings as such, more than 35 independent landed nobles (though some of their territories are no larger than a town), and more than a hundred noble families besides.

The allegiances that bind the Kingdom together are very fragile; they can shift, form and break all too quickly.
Because of this, the Kingdoms' politics can be incredibly treacherous, as different power-blocks jostle for control.

Only sometimes can one King credibly claim rulership over all (or just
*enough*) of the Kingdoms to claim the title of High King---and such a High King's rule is often tenuous, as they will never be without enemies, rivals and usurpers.

There have been three High Kingships in the Kingdoms' history.
There first High Kingship lasted from CY 255 to CY 281; this short-lived dynasty collapsed 10 years after passing form its founder to its first heir, rent apart by an internal power struggle. The second High Kingship lasted from CY 361 to CY 435; these High Kings were substantially more warlike, and were in constant conflict with both the Dragonshire to their east and the Goblin Kings to their South.  The second Kingship collapsed after a series of disastrous military adventures between CY 429-CY 433.  The third High Kingship began in CY 695, and has lasted to the present day.  This High Kingship had good relations with the Dragonshire, and now has good relations with the Commonwealth.

The Kingdoms can be roughly divided between their western and eastern halves.  The western Kingdoms are relatively open; they have benefited heavily from trade with the Commonwealth, and have little interest in conflict with their wealthy and powerful neighbor.  Unsurprisingly, the present High King hails from a city-state in the western Kingdoms.

The eastern Kingdoms are far more cruel; the Three Cities that built the Empire lie in the eastern portion, and to this day many of the residents there are quick to believe that humans should hold dominion over all other races (and that those whose ancestors built the Empire should hold dominion over all other humans).

The current High King is one Kass Ahnaff, who is the king of the city-kingdom of Annhallan (styled as Wise Westking and Merchentmen City in Common).  Merchentmen City is in the Western Kingdoms; it lies not on the border with the Commonwealth, but rather near the shores of the Kings' Sea.  Kass has enthusiastically pursued better relations with the Commonwealth, and has made only the barest pretense to disguise his willingness to cooperate with the Commonwealth to combat the nobles of the East who would see him deposed.  Many easterners view Kass as the worst human being alive.

### <span id="kingdoms-economy"></span> The Kingdoms' Economy

The Kingdoms are a relatively wealthy and sophisticated society, particularly in the West, where they have benefited heavily with trade with the Dragonshire the Commonwealth.
During the peace that has prevailed between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms since 695, merchants have crossed the borders between the Commonwealth and the Kingdoms, enriching communities on both sides; notably, rivers running east from the Worldspine give Commonwealth merchants easy access to the many ports on the Kings' Sea, the large inland sea that separates the Kingdoms of Men from the Goblin Empire.

Notably, knowledge also crosses the border, as scholars and innovations from the Dragonshire often cross into the Kingdoms, and vice versa.

Unfortunately, this thriving trade does put strain on the east-west divide within the Kingdoms; Commonwealth traders seldom venture into the Eastern Kingdoms, and so the wealth produced by trade is concentrated in the west.

### <span id="kingdoms-other-races"></span> Other Races

The Kingdoms of Men is a government of men, in their traditional territories; with few exceptions, they have not treated with the other races that may have dwelt within their borders, and instead have displaced them; any that remain are not recognized and citizens, but can only ever be subjects of the Kingdoms.

There is one notable exception; the Kingdom of Haffa in the northwest.  Elves and humans are nearly unique in that they are able to interbreed, although these hybrids are usually sterile (and often suffer other ailments); the half-human, half-elven population of much of Haffa, including the noble line that rules the kingdom, are exceptions to this rule---they are not sterile, and do not commonly suffer any other ailment from their mixed blood.  (It is rumored that magical intervention may have been required to achieve this; whether this is true---and if so, what that intervention was, or what price was likely paid---has been lost to history.)

Unsurprisingly, the Haffa are enemies-by-necessity of the Eastern Kingdoms, who view them as mongrels and half-breeds at best; the Haffa are strong supporters of the current High King and his line.  Notably, though, they usually have no special affinity for tribal Elves living within the Commonwealth's borders, and to the west of the Worldspine.

Conversely, a particularly grim moment in the history of the Kingdoms' relations with an attempt launched in the Eastern Kingdoms to exterminate their indigenous Kobold population; this led to a mass exodus of Kobolds from the entire Kingdoms.  A few scant pockets of Kobold populations remain in the Western Kingdoms; some settled in the Dragonshire, owing partly to their ability to speak the Drakes' language; far larger number settled deep under the Worldspine; and many more still continued on to the Haven Isles.  In the Commonwealth, Kobolds have prospered and become numerous; this is not the least of the reasons that the Commonwealth views the Eastern Kingdoms as their enemy.

### <span id="kingdoms-military"></span> The Military

Rapid improvements in the quality and availability of steel plate armor---in both the Kingdoms and the Dragonshire---have been the major driver of military tactics in the Kingdoms.  The Kingdoms have sophisticated-enough metallurgy that they can produce large numbers of weapons and armors made of high-quality steel, but they cannot produce it on the scale that the Commonwealth can, and so steel plate armor in particular remains primarily the province of knights (who are often drawn from the ranks of the noble and the wealthy).

Knights are among the most iconic of the Kingdoms' combatants; horse-mounted human Knights in full plate are mobile, heavily-armored and difficult to strike, making them a devastating force on the battlefield.  Many of the kingdoms have long traditions of horse-back riding and archery; because of this, besides mounted Knights, the Kingdoms can boast large numbers of skilled light cavalry and archers---especially masters of the devastating-though-difficult longbow.  In recent years, however, the prominence of longbow archers has fallen away, as the Kingdoms now commonly arms its peasant infantry with easy-to-use and powerful crossbows.

In its early years, each noble and each kingdom was responsible for contributing to the Kingdoms' military from their own resources; though the Kingdoms where often capable of fielding a large and effective army, they could suffer from inconsistent standards of equipment, composition and discipline.  One innovation achieved during the interregnum between the Second and Third High Kings was a standardization of the kinds of combatants that each kingdom was expected to furnish.  Though the *enforcement* of these standards is still subject to the Kingdoms' internal politics, their military is nevertheless far more consistent and unified today than it has been in centuries past.

The Kingdoms typically view their Knights as their most elite and powerful combatants, and they are typically the centerpiece of their military strategy.  After the Knights, their light cavalry and archers are their most prominent forces.  They often field a small number of professional infantry, who they place at the front of their lines, and support with larger numbers of mercenaries, mustered peasants and even conscripted prisoners; unsurprisingly, the discipline, morale and effectiveness of the last two categories can vary widely.

Though not a fact that is often spoken aloud---especially in the Eastern Kingdoms---the Kingdoms of Men are entirely militarily overmatched by the Commonwealth.  Though the Commonwealth cannot boast the large number of Knights that the Kindgoms can, the Commonwealth is richer, has better access to steel, is *much* larger, has a much larger professional military, and can draw on the much greater physical strength of Gnolls and Drakes.

The Kingdoms, however, *are* a match for their neighbor to the south, the Goblin Empire, which led the Goblins in years past to sail south from the Emerald Plane and seek riches (and weaker opponents) on the Ruby Plane.  This influx of wealth (and new source of fighting experience for their infantry), however, has led to a significant improvement in the Goblin Empire's military; this in turn has not escaped the notice of the Kingdoms of Men.

### <span id="kingdoms-other-nations"></span> Other Nations

At present, the Kingdoms of Men are at peace with the Commonwealth, and are not at war with the Goblin Empire.
The High King has fostered good relations with the people of the Commonwealth, and the people of the Western Kingdom have prospered from it.
This state of affairs is precarious, however, as many within the Eastern Kingdoms would dearly love to seize the thrown---and thereafter to reclaim long-lost territories from the Dragonshire, to law the Commonwealth and the Goblin Empire low, and to restore humanity to preeminence in the land east of the Worldspine.

They could never achieve this on their own, however, even *if* they could command the undisputed loyalty of all the kings and nobles of the Kingdoms of Men; therefore, the nobles of the East are searching for allies.

The rules of the West are not ignorant of this---the kings of the far east are seldom subtle in their contempt for non-humans---and so they are seeking allies, too.  And so, the struggle for rule of the Kingdoms of Men has become something of a proxy war between all the great powers of the continent.

If the Easterners can seize control of the Kingdoms, and if they strike an alliance with the Goblin Empire and the Shaded Sea Peoples---even a temporary one---then the Commonwealth is doomed; if, however, the current high-king can solidify his control, then an alliance with the Commonwealth is a possibility---and should that happen, the Shaded Sea People and the Goblinoid Empire would in turn be hopelessly outmatched.

Fortunately for the Commonwealth and the Western Kingdoms, a nightmare alliance between the Shaded Sea People, the Goblins and the Eastern Kingdoms seems unlikely; the Human and Goblin nations have a long history of conflict, and the Shaded Sea People have no significant contact with either; what's more, the Eastern Kingdom's obvious contempt for non-humans would make such an alliance difficult to strike (and impossible to sustain).

## <span id="anchor-18"></span>The Shaded Sea People

  - Alliance of Ratfolk and Shade Elves.
  - Shade elves originate in the Southwestern corner of the Emerald
    Plane, where they were a fearsome mounted raiding people.
  - Ratfolk originate in an island chain 300km off the coast, where they
    where skilled sailors.
  - Complex history of raiding and violence.
  - Both Shade Elves and then Ratfolk where forced to pay tribute by a
    third, rarely-encountered people, the Leapers.
  - They raided each-other to meet the tribute demands, until some 400
    years ago, when they instead allied with each other and turned to
    raiding the Commonwealth.
  - Their siege of Islandholme in CY 447 is a major turning point; their
    devastating defeat depletes the resources of the houses that mounted
    the attack.
  - They turned to raiding the Ratfolk who had settled on the Raptor’s
    Plane, fleeing their cruel cousins; this ended when they allied with
    the Raptors, and eventually ejected the Shaded Sea Peoples from
    Raptor’s Plane.
  - At present, they are still an active piratical and raiding culture,
    and they still have several “client” populations in the Shaded Sea
    and on Emerald Plane.

## <span id="anchor-19"></span>The Raptor’s Alliance

  - The Raptor’s Alliance
  - On the Raptor’s Plane, in the North-West and Central regions of the
    continent.
  - An alliance formed almost 400 years ago to resist piracy and raiding
    by Shaded Sea People.
  - United the Raptors with Ratfolk who had settled on the North-West
    shore, fleeing the cruelty of their cousins.
  - First contacted 300 years ago, with heavy travel beginning 200 years
    ago.
  - Friendly with the Commonwealth, though independent.
  - May be forced into closer alliance, as they are pressured by Goblins
    on the Eastern shore and Shaded Sea peoples on the West.

## <span id="anchor-20"></span>The Goblin Kings

  - In South-East of Emerald Plain – East of Dragonshire, South of
    Kingdoms of Men
  - also on North-Eastern edge of the Raptor’s Plane.
  - In the past, they were a much bigger threat; the Commonwealth and
    Kingdoms have since grown militarily too powerful, and the Goblinoid
    Kingdoms have been “contained.”
  - Rather than die out, they’ve crossed the Gulf and begun colonizing
    the island-continent to the South.
  - There they have subjugated several of the races they’ve encountered,
    and have begun to become wealthy.
