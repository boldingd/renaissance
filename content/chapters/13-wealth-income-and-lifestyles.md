## Wealth

Wealth is represented by a *wealth level*, and a number of *wealth dots*.
Characters have a wealth level between 0 and 5; these wealth levels are described in the table below.
(Note that the wealth scale is "non-linear"; there is a very wide gap between the amount of wealth that Wealth Level 4 represents and the amount of money that Wealth Level 5 represents.)

| Wealth Level | Name           | Desc                                                           |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | no possessions | You have no possessions                                        |
| 1            | peasant        | You are poor, like a tenant farmer                             |
| 2            | local artisan  | You have a reliable income and some disposable wealth          |
| 3            | merchant       | You can afford a comfortable lifestlye                         |
| 4            | local wealthy  | You are quite wealthy, perhaps the richest person within miles |
| 5            | noble          | You are exceptionally wealthy, possessed of a king's fortune   |

You also have a certain number of *wealth dots*.
Each dot has a wealth level; you get three dots at your wealth level, and four dots at each lower level.
(Wealth Level 0 is specials: since it represents absolute poverty—the lack of any meaningful wealth—you don't get any level 0 wealth dots.)

As an example, Fire the scholar has wealth level 3—he's an educated professional, and he makes a comfortable living for himself.
He gets 3 dots at level 3, 4 dots at level 2, and 4 dots at level 1—and, of course, no dots at level 0, since there aren't level 0 wealth dots.

Your wealth dots start out *full,* but they can also be *depleted*.
A depleted dot isn't gone, it's just taped-out; you've used the liquid part of those assets, so they can't be used in bartering (see Bartering below).
Depleted dots can be *restored;* one way to do this is by working for an income (see Income, Investments and Lifestyles below)

## Purchasing Things

Characters in *Renaissance* can have widely varying wealth levels.
Sometimes a character may wish to acquire an item well within their means; in these cases, success is nearly automatic.
Other times, a character may wish they could acquire an item well beyond their means; in these cases, they're out of luck.
Still other times, though, characters may wish to acquire an item expensive item that will stretch their resources; then, they *barter*.

Each item has a *cost level*, according to its *cost category*: a Trivial item is Cost Level 1, a minor item is Cost Level 2, and so on up to Cost Level 5 for Extreme items (see the *Items* chapter).
When you wish to purchase an item (or service), compare its *cost level* to the highest *wealth level* at which you have a full wealth dot.

- If the item's cost level is **more than 1 level lower** than the level of your highest full dot, then you acquire the item automatically.  You don't need to barter for it or deplete a dot of wealth; the cost of the item is so tiny compared to your wealth and resources that we don't bother trying to track it.
- If the item's cost level is **1 level lower** than your highest full dot, then you can acquire the item, but the cost of the item is high enough that we'll need to track the impact it has on your finances—that is, you'll need to either deplete a dot to pay for it or *barter* (see below).  If you do barter, you gain a +20 bonus to checks related to bartering for the item.
- If the item's cost level is **the same** as your highest full dot, then you must either deplete a dot or barter.
- If the item's cost level is **1 level higher** than your highest full dot, then you must either deplete a dot to pay for it or barter; however, you suffer a -20 penalty while bartering.
- If the item's cost level is **more than 1 level higher** than your highest full dot, then you can't purchase the item; it's simply beyond your means.
- If you are **wealth level 0,** then you can't purchase items—you don't have any wealth, so you can't pay for anything.

These rules are summarized in the table below:

| Item Cost vs. Wealth Level                   | Result                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Item cost is more than 1 less than wealth    | don't deplete dot            |
| Item cost is 1 less than wealth level        | deplete dot or barter; barter at \+20  |
| Item cost is the same as wealth level        | deplete dot or barter        |
| Item cost is 1 higher than wealth level      | deplete dot or barter; barter at \-20  |
| Item cost is more than 1 greater than wealth | cannot purchase              |
| You are wealth level 0                       | cannot purchase              |

### Character Wealth

The wealth-and-trade system may seem a little odd to someone coming from a game that meters wealth in gold, silver and copper;
why is it put together this way?

One simple reason is that this game is based partly on *Eclipse Phase*, and *Eclipse Phase* uses a similar cost-level system.
But that's far from the entire motivation!

Much like *Eclipse Phase*, we want players to be able to play characters with wildly different wealth levels--running from penniless peasants to Dukes and Lords.
We don't want to measure a character's power and advancement in terms of powerful items and wealth.
Players should be able to *choose* how important wealth is to their concept for their character, and in order to do that, they should be able to either start out wealthy (like Lady Katrine, the noble-born merchant) or stay poor (like Aryn the hunter or Lohrs the folk-hero, either of whome are as like as not to refuse a reward) without breaking a "treasure-by-level" table.

Also, like *Eclipse Phase*, in *Renaissance*, "character who provides the party with things that they need" is intended to be a player role, rather than an NPC role, and "being incredibly rich and just buying things" is a valid strategy for succeeding in that role.
And, as a design principle, we also wish to avoid keeping track of tedious and unimportant details.
Taken together, this means that our wealth system should allow a wealthy character (like Lady Katrine or General Chandra) to purchase a wide variety of useful things for the party, without bogging the game down in "cash-register math" and *especially* without wasting time trying to figure out how Lady Katrine "makes change" out of her immense estate to buy a meal.

Though we tend to really enjoy moving the role of "wealthy provisioner" into the space of jobs players can do, there is something of a flip-side; if "provisioner" is a player role, then that means that someone *needs* to do it.
If the party doesn't have a character who has at least *some* access to funds, they'll be missing an important role--a "gotcha" that can catch people used to traditional party construction by surprise!

</aside>

## Bartering

Before the era of central banks and stable currencies, prices where fluid and people *bartered.*

If your wealth level is near the cost level of the thing you're trying to purchase, you can simply deplete a wealth dot at your highest level to pay for it, or you can *barter.*
Bartering gives you a chance to acquire the item without depleting a dot

Normally, bartering is a one-minute Task Action that requires a Protocol check; sometimes, however, the GM (or the player) may decide to talk with the merchant in-character and try to convince them using their social skills (and professions).
If you score an Exceptional Success on your Protocol check—or do a similarly good job talking with the merchant in-character—then you acquire the item (or service) without depleting a wealth dot; this represents you finding some way to pay the merchant that doesn't significantly impact your net wealth.
However, if you score an exceptional failure, you cannot acquire the item—maybe the merchant doesn't want anything you've got for trade, maybe they decide that they just don't like you, or something else happens to sour the deal.

## Trade Goods and Currency

The rules for wealth and bartering assume that you have access to all of the assets that represent your wealth.
For example, if you're wealth level 3, some of your wealth will be in the form of currencies, valuable goods, properties (like your house), professional commitments, and so on; the system above assumes that you can leverage all of these assets to pay for something.
Under some situations—notably, if you're travelling far from where your character lives—this might not be the case.
In these cases, you'll need to either use *trade goods* to represent the portion of your wealth that you've taken with you, or you'll need to use *currency.*

### Trade Goods

Tade goods work much like wealth dots; they have an associated *wealth level,* and can be used in place of a (full) wealth dot in the rules for purchasing items above.
However, trade goods *cannot* be depleted; instead, you spend them, and they're gone.

Creating a *trade good* requires converting some of your various assets into portable valuables—currencies, valuable commodities, gems and jewelry, and the like.
This requires some time, as given by the table below, and that you deplete a wealth dot of the same level as the trade good that you're producing.

The process can also be reversed: a trade good can be consumed to refresh a depleted wealth dot; this takes the same time as producing a trade good of the same level.

| Level | Time |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1     | 2 hour Task Action |
| 2     | 4 hour Task Action |
| 3     | 1 shift Job |
| 4     | 2 shift Job |
| 5     | 5 shift Job |

Note that *level 5 Trade Goods,* for example, represent very small and very valuable items—rare gems, legendary jewelry, priceless relics, deeds to valuable lands and so on.
Carrying around this kind of wealth might make a character a target for bandits, and may tempt even the honest.

### Currency

Sometimes it's just easiest to price things in a *currency.*
Though central banks and stable currencies are centuries off, there do still exist banks issuing bank notes, and the Commonwealth, the Kingdoms of Men and the Goblinoid Kingdoms have all minted coins of precious metals.

For simplicity, we'll give prices in *copper* and *gold* pieces, with one gold piece equal to 100 copper pieces.
Similar to trade goods, you can deplete dots of wealth to produce currency, and you can expend currency to refresh a depleted wealth dot (use the same time-spans as for creating trade goods).

| Level | Price Range   | Wealth Dot |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1     | 1–9 copper    | 5 copper   |
| 2     | 1–9 gold      | 5 gold     |
| 3     | 10–49 gold    | 25 gold    |
| 4     | 50–499 gold   | 250 gold   |
| 5     | 500–5000 gold | 2500 gold  |

## Income, Investments and Lifestyles

Most characters need to work for a living—even those who are independantly wealthy have likely put their wealth to work by investing.

### Income

You can work for income during down-time; working for income is a 20-shift *job*.
(This is intended to line up roughly with one month of work; your GM may adjust this time-scale based on how many days you work in a given week, how long you work each day, or other factors.)
You must have at least 20 ranks in a Profession to work for income, although a check using one of your profession skills is not required under normal circumstances (under exceptional circumstances, a check may be required—for example, if you are a farmer and there is a drought).

After completing all 20 shifts of work, you are credited with your income; you may either refresh one of your highest-level wealth dots, or any three lower-level wealth dots.

### Investments

Your character can put their wealth to work producing more wealth.

Investments represent planted fields, stakes in businesses, trade caravans loaded with your goods, and so on.
Like investments and trade goods, they have an associated level, from 1 to 5.

Investments aren’t liquid assets, so you can’t spend them like wealth dots or trade goods.
Instead, investments *generate* wealth for you.
At the end of each month, for each investment that you have, you may refresh one dot of wealth of the same level, or three dots at a lower level, just as if you had *worked for income* as above.

Creating an investment involves converting some of your liquid wealth into an illiquid form—that is, essentially, you have to lose a wealth dot to create an investment.
Converting a wealth do to an investment is a 5 shift job and requires a successful Protocol check, Profession: Investor check, or other reasonable check

Conversely, you can *liquidate* an investment, turning it back into a wealth dot; this is also a 5-shift job, and also requires a Protocol check, Profession: Investor check, or other reasonable check.
(Note that "liquidating an investment" might involve quite a bit of misery for whoever you had invested in, which might turn into an interesting roleplaying moment, or possibly even an adventure hook!)

Investments can be handled in the abstract, but cinematically-minded players may wish to detail the businesses that they have invested in; cooperative GMs might use this information to inform how their investments function.
Note that, in this case, choosing to liquidate an investment could become particularly impactful.

### Lifestyles

Your character lives a certain lifestyle, which incurs expenses.

Lifestyles have levels from 0 to 5, just like wealth; see the table below for descriptions.
At the beginning of each month, you pick your level of lifestyle; you must then deplete a dot of the same level to pay for it.

| Level | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0 (begger) | You live of what you can beg, steal or scrounge, dwelling in alleys, woods and caves. |
| 1 (peasant) | You live a humble life, with long hours of work and no luxuries; you know want and hunger well. |
| 2 (poor) | Though poor, your basic needs are met, and you may have access to the occasional luxury. |
| 3 (comfortable) | Your needs are reliably met, and you have some amount of leisure time, and you have access to modest luxuries.  You likely own your own house. |
| 4 (wealthy) | You have amassed significant wealth, enough that you can afford a luxurious lifestyle for quite some time. |
| 5 (noble) | You own a king's fortune, perhaps literally; if managed wisely, you and your descendants will not need to work for generations. |

## Changing your Wealth Level

  - You can change your wealth level during down-time. However, this is
    very difficult to do.
  - You may proceed from one wealth level to the next, one at a time,
    using the following checks.

|                   |                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1 (peasant)       | 3 months, profession check at +10 |
| 2 (local artisan) | 6 months, Profession check        |
| 3 (merchant)      | 1 year, Profession check          |
| 4 (local wealthy) | 2 years, Profession check at -20  |
| 5 (noble)         | 5 years, Profession check at -30  |

# The Old Wealth Rules

Each item has a *cost level*, according to its *cost category*: a Trivial item is Cost Level 1, a minor item is Cost Level 2, and so on up to Cost Level 5 for Extreme items (see the *Items* chapter).

  - When you want to purchase something:
    
      - You might need to roll a Barter check, to determine if you and
        the merchant can reach a deal; consult the table below to see if
        a check is required, and if it has a modifier.
      - If you succeed, the merchant is willing to sell you the item,
        and you can pay for it without affecting your net wealth; you
        receive the item, and you don’t deplete a dot.
      - If you fail, the merchant is willing to sell you the item, but
        they drive a hard bargain; you can choose to either deplete a
        dot and receive the item, or to go without (you don’t deplete a
        dot and don’t get the item).
      - If you score an exceptional failure, then you can’t reach a deal
        with the merchant; maybe their stock is low, or you don’t have
        something they want, or they decide they don’t like you.

  - Sidebar: Paying Up Front
    
      - If you don’t want to try to barter for an item—or if your
        character isn’t particularly good at bartering—the GM may allow
        you to skip the barter check and simply deplete a dot of wealth.
      - Some items may not be available without bartering.

  - Sidebar: Holding Back
    
      - Sometimes, you might want to conceal the full extent of your
        financial resources; we call this *holding back*.
      - When holding back, you can choose to use a lower wealth level
        than your highest one.
      - You have to have an available dot at the level that you choose
        to use, and if you deplete a dot, you must deplete a dot at that
        level.

  - A depleted dot isn’t gone, it’s just tapped out; you’ve used the
    liquid part of those assets.
    
      - You can restore a depleted dot during down-time, see below.

  - Wealth level is selected during character creation, see *Character
    *Creation for rules.

|                                              |                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Item Cost vs. Wealth Level                   | Barter Test       |
| Item cost is more than 1 less than wealth    | Automatic success |
| Item cost is 1 less than wealth level        | \+20 bonus        |
| Item cost is the same as wealth level        | No modifier       |
| Item cost is 1 higher than wealth level      | \-20 penalty      |
| Item cost is more than 1 greater than wealth | Automatic failure |
| You are wealth level 0                       | You can’t barter  |

## Income, Investments and Lifestyles

  - You can work for income during down-time.
    
      - Working for income is a 20-shift job; you must have at least 10
        ranks in a profession, but no check is required.
        
          - Let’s not require a profession check, because it’s tedious
            and because the failure case is irritating to handle (your
            character abruptly gets 0 income?).
    
      - If you succeed, you either restore a depleted dot of wealth at
        your highest level, or two lower-level dots.

  - Your character lives a certain lifestyle, which incurs expenses.
    
      - Lifestyles have levels from 0 to 5, just like wealth; see the
        table below for descriptions.
      - At the beginning of each month, pick a lifestyle for that month,
        and deplete a dot of the same level to pay for it.

  - Your character can put their wealth to work producing more wealth.
    
      - Investments represent planted fields, investments in businesses,
        traveling trade caravans and so on.
    
      - They aren’t liquid assets, so you can’t spend them.
    
      - Investments have a level from 1 to 5.
    
      - You can convert a dot of wealth into an investment; you loose
        the dot, but you gain an investment at the specified level.
        
          - Converting a dot of wealth to an investment is a 5 shift job
            and requires a successful Barter, Profession: Investor or
            similar check.
    
      - Every month, your investments generate wealth.
        
          - At the end of every month, for each investment that you
            have, you may refresh one dot of wealth of the same level.
    
      - You can liquidate an investment, converting it back into a dot
        of wealth; this is a 5 shift job and requires a successful
        Barter, Profession: Investor or similar check.
    
      - Investments can be handled in the abstract, but some players may
        wish to detail exactly what their character’s holdings and
        investments look
like.
