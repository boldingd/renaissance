## Overview

In Commonwealth Year 830, the Commonwealth is a sophisticated, peaceful, mercantile civilization.
It is far-and-away the largest and wealthiest civilization in the known world; it stretches from the shores of the King's Sea in the east to the western coast of the Emerald Plabe, and to the Haven Isles beyond.
All this territory is united in a prosperous web of trade, overseen by the Commonwealth Council.

The Commonwealth is broken into six provinces:

- **Dragonshire Province** lies in the northeast, to the west of the Kingdoms of Men.  It was an independant kingdom under the (nominal) rulership of the Dragon Karrach, until it was incorporated into the Commonwealth with the Compact.
- **Heartland Province** is the territory to the southeast, south of the Dragonshire and west of the Gobline Empire.  This is the territory where the Commonwealth was born.  It is still governed as a network of manors, united by a web of charters and contracts.
- **Haven Province** consists of the Haven Isles, and island chain off the west coast of the Emerald Plane; the largest island is Islandhome.  Haven Province has a sophisticated, tiered political structure, and is something of a hot-bed for political thought.  It's also known for its warm climate, its large urban centers, its olive fields, and its brisk ocean winds.
- **Herd-and-Pack Province** consists of the territory of the former Herd-and-Pack Alliance, a group of Herder, Gnollish and other tribes that united to stand against the Shade Elves.  Long an ally of the Commonwealth, it was incorporated as a Province with the Compact.
- **Northland Province** consists of the far north, both to the east and west of the Worldspine Mountains.  It largely consists of the Dwarven and Orcish holds that chose to join the Commonwealth; not all of them did.
- **Westward Province** consists of a narrow strip of land claimed by the commonwealth, running from the Worldspine Mountain to the west coast of the Emerald Plane.  It runs along the northern broder of the open grasslands claimed by the Shade Elves of the Shaded sea; it sees constant raiding, and is heavily fortified.

The Commonwealth also contains several City-States — large cities that are treated as provinces unto themselves:

- **South-Harbor** is a major port-city built into the steep, irregular cliffs of the southern Worldspine.  Besides its role as a major port, it also hosts a substantial fleet-yard for the Commonwealth Navy, and is the current seat of the Commonwealth Council.
- **Crossroads** actually consists of two cities, one above-ground and one below, built in the middle of the Worldspine.  It is a major trade-hub, sitting at the nexus of both above- and below-ground trade routes.
- **Prosperity** is the largest city in Heartland Province — or it would be, if it were part of Heartland Province instead of being an independant city-state.  Besides being a trade hub, Prosperity is known for its cosmopolitan population, the quality of its universities — and its unusually-elaborate government, compared to the rest of Heartland.

The Commonwealth is overseen by the Commonwealth Council.
The council doesn't *govern* the Commonwealth — it does not make laws or prosecute criminals — but it does negotiate with other nations, make treaties, declare war, settle disputes between provinces, collect taxes and tariffs, and spend those monies on its various agencies.

Among those agencies are the Commonwealth Artisans, who maintain a network of roads, bridges, dams, and locks; the Commonwealth Patrol, who secures the vast interior; the Commonwealth Army and Navy, who defend the Commonwealth; and the Commonwealth Arbiters, who help to settle internal disputes.
Because of the work of these Council Agencies, the Commonwealth is secure, stable and prosperous.

[[designnote]]
| The Commonwealth is, by design, a little different than your typical fantasy nation: it is a large, prosperous, secure, just and diverse society.
| This means that a lot of typical fantasy adventure structures don't work: there are no bandit gangs to slay; typical "monster" races are your allies; and your society is richer and more sophisticated than any ancient ruins scattered about.
|
| The Commonwealth's major concerns — and thus, the sources for typical adventures — are external: strange wonders that explorers uncovered at the edge of the known world; intrigues and threats brewing in neighboring nations; and the machinations of hostile Great Spirits.

## Commonwealth Technology

[[designnote]]
| In general, we're shooting for a level of technology roughly approximating Europe in the 1500s.
| Innovations like the three-field rotation, the use of horses in agriculture, the development of gunpowder and the development of the printing press occurred decades or centuries ago, and have begun to transform society.
| Just as importantly, they've also begun to develop very sophisticated philosophical thought — beginning to develop the ideas behind rationalism, and to contemplate the design of political systems to serve their peoples.
|
| However, you should not assume that the Commonwealth is precisely equivalent to Europe at the beginning of the Renaissance; we'd like to incorporate ideas from other great civilizations.
|
| Please also note that we aren't historians; please forgive us any minor errors.
| (We're always open to making our world more historically plausible, or being introduced to new, interesting ideas that we can incorporate.)

The Commonwalth is arguably the most sophisticated nation in the known world.

They have developed a number of sophisticated farming techniques, suited to the wide variety of territories that they've integrated: in the interior, this including sophisticated field rotations, differing plow designs appropriate for a wide variety of terrain, water course \[i.e. aqueduct\] irrigation and the use of horses in agriculture; in the southern foothills and marshes, this includes sophisticated flood-plane agriculture and planted terraces to make efficient use of water; and in the Haven Isles, it means aqueduct irrigation and vinyards and orchards.
These innovations allow them to produce a large surplus of food, which in turn allows them to support a large urban populations, to support their large, professional military, and to still have a surplus for trade.
(There is a very good reason that wheat is a symbol of the Commonwealth.)

The Commonwealth also boasts sophisticated artisens, enabled by a network of powerful guilds.
The Commonwealth's architects, masons and carpenters have mastered a number of construction techniques, adapted from the many cultures that they've incorporated and suited to the many different regions that the Commonwealth occupies: masons in the Heartland and Dragonshire have used sophisticated arches, columns, vaulted ceilings and flying buttresses to produce awe-inspiring buildings; Northland is dotted by tember-framed homes, Dwarven dugouts and Orcish holds; the shores of the Haven Isles feature stilted homes constructed by ratfolk; and the peaks of the Haven Isles include incredible underground cities constructed by Kobold and Shade Elven masons and excavators.
The Commonwealth also boasts some of the finest steel produced in the known world, enabling them to produce everything from plows to armor at a scale and of a quality that cannot be rivaled.

The Commonwealth also has access to a rich and diverse cultures, arts, and bodies of knowledge.

Notably, the printing press was invented in Heartland Province some 83 years ago; this has led to an explosion of the written word.
The Commonwealth's large and sophisticated universities are also centers of thought and learning — and cheap printed books and tracts are turning public squares, pubs and libraries into sites of political discourse and the sharing of ideas.
Philosophers, thinkers and academics are pushing the bounds of ethics, natural philosophy, political philosophy, medicine, and the arts.
The Commonwealth's leading thinkers have begun to develop the fundamental ideas behind rationalism, to develop sophisticated political thought, and to explore the precursors of a theory of calculus.

They have also been able to deduce that the world is round, and increasingly sophisticated and capable sailing vessals have enabled them to voyage out into the ocean to explore — and to build increasingly prosperous webs of trade along their coasts and seas.
They have recently begun to construct large, multi-masted vessals, capable of sailing great distances on the open ocean.

The Commonwealth has also developed sophisticated techniques for capturing natural sources of energy.
Windmills, water-wheels and aqueducts allow the citizens of the Commonwealth to use winds and streams in agriculture and artisenry.

They are also making increasingly sophisticated use of gunpowder.
Developed more than two hundred years ago, some of the earliest uses of gunpowder where awkward and dangerous; more modern uses, including fixed cannons and matchlock rifles, are far more effective, and are beginning to change the nature of warfare.

And, of course, the Commonwealth has a sophisticated understanding of magic — although the people of the Commonwealth generally view magic as another aspect of nature to understand, not something beyond the reach of natural philosophy.

## Commonwealth Life, Society and Economy

The vast majority of the population — more than 90% — are farmers, fishers and shephards, living in small communities throughout the countryside.
The Commonwealth includes a wide variety of cultures, so the appearance of these farmers, fishers and shephards can vary widely.
Though these people are often poor, it should be noted that they are not serfs or slaves — unlike in some of the Kingdoms of Men, for example, or in the Goblin Empire.
They often own the fields they work; when they don't, they are at least not the posession of a lord, and are free to depart.

Many of these people know little of the outside world, and may never venture more than half a day’s walk from the place they were born — although, since the signing of the Compact, the Commonwealth has increasingly funded various forms of public education, including traveling teachers and medics meant to provide at least some access to learning to the residents of these small communities.
This means that most residents of the Commonwealth are at least literate and numerate.

Many of these small hamlets of freeholds will be dependant on a nearby manor.
Manors are, classically, overseen by a lord or central organization; though the Commonwealth has abolished formal serfdom, the organizations and lordly manors that founded manors often remain powerful and influential within their sphere.

      - Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be “owned” by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
      - Manors often host local administrators and priests.
      - Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
      - Manors often host traders.
      - Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
      - Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor’s food production.
      - Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

  - Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.
    
      - Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
      - Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes—rivers or major overland routes.
      - Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars—and the lower-class helpers they employ.
      - Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
      - Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
      - Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

  - Major Cities
    
      - Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are *major
        cities*.
      - Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand—sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
      - Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

  - The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.
    
      - Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
      - Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
      - Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
      - The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
      - Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
      - Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
      - Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth’s
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

  - Trading Caravans
    
      - A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
      - Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        *dimorphic*: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
      - Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

  - Underground Societies
    
      - Several commonwealth races—notably Kobolds and Ash Elves—prefer
        to live underground.
      - Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
      - Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
      - They also often support large populations of artisans.
      - They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

  - I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.

## Commonwealth Governance

  - Move/expand above information here.

  - One feature of New Charter is that the Commonwealth can collect
    taxes from its provinces, which the Commonwealth Council can use to
    fund whatever operations they elect to (as opposed to specifically
    funding the patrols and roads under the Compact).
    
      - This has lead to several new Commonwealth Council organizations.

  - One major such organization is the military.
    
      - The Commonwealth has the known world’s preeminent military.
      - Their prosperity allows them to fund a permanent, professional
        military.
      - This military actively patrols their interior and guards their
        frontiers.
      - The security provided by their armed forces allows trade to
        flourish, and the might of their military substantially prevents
        attack by competing societies.
      - Gnolls are a major race in the Commonwealth military, where
        their physical strength and endurance provide a formidable
        advantage over primarily Human, Shade Elf or Goblinoid armies.
      - Kobolds have also found a place within the Commonwealth’s
        armies, where their speed, tough hides and small size can make
        them useful infiltrators, raiders, scouts and spies.

  - Hmm. This section might be redundant to information in the
    Commonwealth Today and Organizations sections; I might also not want
    to go on at length about this. Possibly rework.

## Commonwealth Magic

Though the spirits are often inscrutable and the potential applications
for magic are vast, it is nevertheless true that the sages and scholars
of the Commonwealth have amassed a vast amount of useful knowledge of
magic, and that much of this knowledge has been deployed to the benefit
of the Commonwealth. It is studied in their universities, deployed in
their military, and sold in their cities by clerics and hedge-wizards.
While powerful magic items (e.g. magical weapons and armor) are rare,
simple magical tools and potions are common (see *Items* for a few
examples, by no means complete\!).

Of special note is the recently-developed Kairne Network. Each Kairne is
an unassuming stack of standing-stones, surrounded by an open space and
paced out by smaller Kairnes arranged in a circle. These unassuming
ritual-sights allow magic-users who know how to use them to rapidly
transport themselves from any one Kairne to any other—allowing them to
cover great distances in the blink of an eye. Presently, only a dozen
Kairnes have been constructed, and the Kairne networks remain difficult
to use—in particular, few mages can carry much with them.

## Notable Places

  - Decent names TBD

  - New Kobold trade-town
    
      - One of the Twin Cities, paired with an older, above-ground
        trading city.
      - built under world-spine mountain
      - founded \~200 years ago, growing over time
      - giant, roughly-circular cavern
      - about 9 miles across and 150 feet high
      - population of 500,000 people
      - mostly kobolds, also humans, some Dwarves and Ash Elves
      - split into blocks, built around central support spires
      - families and clans live together
      - small private spaces, large civic spaces
      - cosmopolitan trade town, sitting at intersection of major
        above-ground and underworld trade routes

  - Founding city
    
      - central fortification, surrounded by town and low-wall
      - present population of 20,000 people, large development outside
        of “old town” walls
      - historical interest, but not a major town presently (not on a
        major trade-route)
      - population composed of human, gnoll and halflings

  - Haven Isle capitol
    
      - cosmopolitan city of 300,000 people on shores of Haven Isle
        (Eastern, gulf-side)
      - heavy trade with mainland
      - above-ground (as opposed to dwarf/kobold/ash-elf construction)
      - humans, halflings, ash-elves and kobolds
      - small population of citizen Tempters

  - Three Cities
    
      - three cities under slopes of volcanic mountain on Haven Isle
      - one Ash Elf, one Kobold, one Dwarven
      - (not to be confused with the Three Cities that founded the human
        empire more than a thousand years ago)
      - total population of more than 215K
      - though the Three Cities are independent, they do share a central
        concourse and marketplace, with both surface and under-way
        access. Lots of visitors and merchants come through here.

  - Kethanel
    
      - Kethanel is a city-state located on the island Kethel in the
        gulf that separates the Orcs and Dwarves.
      - Before either the Dwarves or Orcs joined the Commonwealth,
        Kethel was settled equally by six Orcish and six Dwarven clans;
        the two shared the resources of the island—such as they were—and
        coexisted (mostly) peacefully.
      - More than 600 years ago, the Clans of Kethel met in council;
        they agreed, first, that their clan council could make decisions
        for the island as a whole, and second, that Kethel should join
        the Commonwealth, as many other Dwarven and Orcish territories
        had done.
      - Even though Kethel is more than 100 miles across, it is listed
        as a city-state, and is represented by its one major city.
        Kethanel is a city of more than thirty-five thousand situated in
        a wide bay on the continent’s Southern edge.
      - The architecture of Kethanel is striking; the city is built both
        above and below ground, and is built of massive stones carved
        and set by both Orcish and Dwarven hands. It is, not
        coincidentally, a veritable fortress.
      - Kethanel has long been a local trading and fishing hub, its role
        in trade is growing; though it has long been a port for boats
        crossing the gulf, as the Commonwealth’s sea-faring abilities
        improve, boats sailing up and around the coast from the Haven
        Isles have begun to make Kethanel a stopping-point. Some have
        whispered that a Cairn may be built in Kethanel.
      - Though Kethel is still predominantly settled by equal numbers of
        Dwarves and Orcs, after the island joined the Commonwealth it
        saw an influx of more than a thousand Gnolls, mostly of a
        unique, arctic ethnic-group; they settled in the Southeastern
        reaches of the island. More recently, Kethanel City has seen
        substantial Kobold immigration, and a small population of Ash
        Elven merchants have been carried to the city from the Haven
        Isles by boat.

## Organizations

  - Commonwealth Council organizations
    
      - Council Army / Navy / patrols
      - Council Architects: originally built and maintained roads and
        bridges, now also responsible for many large public works (f.ex.
        Dams)
      - Council Colleges: directly fund and run several colleges in
        larger towns, pay for traveling teachers to visit smaller
        communities.
      - Council Mediators: help to settle disputes between provinces;
        disputes ultimately voted on by Commonwealth Council.

  - Professional guilds
    
      - Professional guilds are a major part of the Commonwealth
        economy\!
      - Guilds provide support to tradesmen and professionals.
      - Guilds require dues from members, and work to make sure that
        members aren’t cheating the public.
      - Guilds provide support to members, helping place apprentices
        with them, and helping them make connections to other
        professionals as they travel.

  - Religious orders
    
      - usually polytheistic, help hook mortal supplicants up with any
        spirit who will make a deal
      - since spirits are usually regional, temples usually specialize
        in spirits in the region
      - some are devoted to pursuit of an idea, c.f. most orders that
        produce “paladins” or something like them

  - criminal organizations
    
      - corruption does exist, especially in big cities
      - Smugglers, black-mails, thugs, thieves, and everything else.
