## Overview

  - Present Year: CY 830

  - Commonwealth has 4 Provinces (not counting the Tribal Lands)
    
      - Heartland: original territory. The World-Spine, some territory East, and a large chunk West. Still a network of manors internally
    
      - The Haven Isles: island chain off the Western coast, featuring one large sub-continent island (Islandholm), and several smaller islands. A federalized state in the modern sense.
    
      - Northland: northern territories occupied by Dwarves, consists largely of the Dwarven holds that chose to join the Commonwealth (not all did).
    
      - Tribal Territories: large swaths of central land-mass left un-governed
        
          - complex relationship
          - Not a province, more an Unorganized Territory
          - Some tribes are Commonwealth members or allies, and some are
            not.
    
      - Dragonshire: Territory in the South-East, between Heartland and the Kingdoms of Men. Essentially a constitutional monarchy, with a parliamentary republican government. Where the dragons are from.

      - Westward: a band of territory stretching between the Worldspine Mountain and the western shores of the Emerald Plane.  The tribal territories sit between Westward Province and Northland Province.  On the south, Westward shares a border with the Shade Elves, and that border has seen near-constant conflict; because of this, Westward is heavily militarized.

  - There are four major city-states
    
      - Twin Cities, old (above-ground) trade-city and new Kobold underground metropolis, built one-above-the-other in World Spine Mountains.
      - Port City situated on Southern coast of Emerald Plain
      - Royal City in Dragonshire?
      - 

  - The Commonwealth is stable and prosperous
    
      - internal trade flourishes, mediated by the river-boats, by halfling and human trade caravans, and by sailing along the coast.
    
      - The Commonwealth Council collects taxes, negotiates with external nations, and runs the Council organizations (like the Military and the Engineers).
        
          - The Council can amend the Compact, although it’s hard.
          - The Council also manages inter-province disputes.
          - Note that the Council doesn’t make law, each province does that for themselves.
    
      - The Commonwealth is internally stable.
        
          - The military keeps the peace.
          - People identify as Commonwealth citizens; they view this as important as racial or provincial identities.
    
      - well-funded professional military (internal police, army, navy)
        
          - provides a high level of security, and thus enables trade
    
      - beginnings of public school system, libraries and museums
    
      - well-maintained roads, prosperous internal trade

  - major concern is their neighbors
    
      - Long-term conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples.
      - The Kingdom of Men is internally unstable, and could easily switch from being an ally to an enemy.
      - Though not at war with the Goblin Kingdoms, they have very little trade and no cooperation; the Kingdom is hostile, and is actively in conflict with an ally (the Raptor’s Alliance).

  - Internal corruption still exists
    
      - notably in cities, and notably in the Heartland Province

  - Also, the whims of the spirits are a constant source of trouble; though some spirits are friendly, and some others can be bought, but many others are both inscrutable and powerful—operating by rules that neither mortals nor lesser spirits understand, and willing to upend the affairs of lower beings for their own ends.

## Commonwealth Technology

  - I’m bad at history, but shooting for something-like Europe in 1200-1400.
    
      - I want them to have an impressive cultures, so I might bump that
        target year forward a little.

  - “Dark Ages” innovations occurred in Commonwealth around CY 300-500:
    
      - heavy plow, three-field rotation, yoking horses for agriculture

  - (and, of course, they can make steel, ink, paper, brick, masonry,
    ...)

  - Have invented black powder, is used in cannons
    
      - man-portable guns don’t generally exist, but
      - GM’s could introduce blunderbusses or smooth-bore muzzle-loaders
        without too much disruption

  - Commonly harness natural energy
    
      - windmills and water-wheels used to grind grain, pump water

  - Use of steam in heated baths, although not yet as an energy source
    (i.e. steam power)

  - Printing press invented 75 years ago (CY 755), society still
    adjusting from sudden surge in literature

## Commonwealth Life, Society and Economy

  - 90% of people are farmers, living in villages of a few hundred
    people.
    
      - Most of the other people in these villages are also farmers –
        that is, not artisans, bureaucrats, traders, soldiers or
        priests.
      - Though the income of these people is marginal, they are not
        serfs—they are not owned by local nobles, at least not in the
        Commonwealth at least.
      - Many of these people know very little of the outside world, and
        will never be more than half a day’s walk from the place they
        were born.
      - Usefully for these people, the Commonwealth funds traveling
        teachers and medics. While they don’t provide anything like a
        modern education system, they do at least guarantee that most
        citizens are literate and numerate, and that they have a sketch
        idea of their own history.
      - Village farmers usually produce food for their own subsistence,
        and to feed the nearby manor to which they are associated.
      - Typically populated by a few hundred people, usually of the same
        race (owing mainly to the need to have potential mates). Most
        villages are populated by either humans or gnolls.

  - Manors are large settlements; they are scattered throughout the
    countryside.
    
      - Manors are, classically, overseen by a lord or central
        organization; though the Commonwealth has abolished formal
        serfdom, the organizations and lordly manors that founded manors
        often remain powerful and influential within their sphere.
      - Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be “owned” by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
      - Manors often host local administrators and priests.
      - Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
      - Manors often host traders.
      - Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
      - Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor’s food production.
      - Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

  - Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.
    
      - Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
      - Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes—rivers or major overland routes.
      - Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars—and the lower-class helpers they employ.
      - Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
      - Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
      - Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

  - Major Cities
    
      - Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are *major
        cities*.
      - Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand—sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
      - Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

  - The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.
    
      - Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
      - Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
      - Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
      - The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
      - Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
      - Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
      - Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth’s
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

  - Trading Caravans
    
      - A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
      - Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        *dimorphic*: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
      - Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

  - Underground Societies
    
      - Several commonwealth races—notably Kobolds and Ash Elves—prefer
        to live underground.
      - Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
      - Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
      - They also often support large populations of artisans.
      - They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

  - I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.

## Commonwealth Governance

  - Move/expand above information here.

  - One feature of New Charter is that the Commonwealth can collect
    taxes from its provinces, which the Commonwealth Council can use to
    fund whatever operations they elect to (as opposed to specifically
    funding the patrols and roads under the Compact).
    
      - This has lead to several new Commonwealth Council organizations.

  - One major such organization is the military.
    
      - The Commonwealth has the known world’s preeminent military.
      - Their prosperity allows them to fund a permanent, professional
        military.
      - This military actively patrols their interior and guards their
        frontiers.
      - The security provided by their armed forces allows trade to
        flourish, and the might of their military substantially prevents
        attack by competing societies.
      - Gnolls are a major race in the Commonwealth military, where
        their physical strength and endurance provide a formidable
        advantage over primarily Human, Shade Elf or Goblinoid armies.
      - Kobolds have also found a place within the Commonwealth’s
        armies, where their speed, tough hides and small size can make
        them useful infiltrators, raiders, scouts and spies.

  - Hmm. This section might be redundant to information in the
    Commonwealth Today and Organizations sections; I might also not want
    to go on at length about this. Possibly rework.

## Commonwealth Magic

Though the spirits are often inscrutable and the potential applications
for magic are vast, it is nevertheless true that the sages and scholars
of the Commonwealth have amassed a vast amount of useful knowledge of
magic, and that much of this knowledge has been deployed to the benefit
of the Commonwealth. It is studied in their universities, deployed in
their military, and sold in their cities by clerics and hedge-wizards.
While powerful magic items (e.g. magical weapons and armor) are rare,
simple magical tools and potions are common (see *Items* for a few
examples, by no means complete\!).

Of special note is the recently-developed Kairne Network. Each Kairne is
an unassuming stack of standing-stones, surrounded by an open space and
paced out by smaller Kairnes arranged in a circle. These unassuming
ritual-sights allow magic-users who know how to use them to rapidly
transport themselves from any one Kairne to any other—allowing them to
cover great distances in the blink of an eye. Presently, only a dozen
Kairnes have been constructed, and the Kairne networks remain difficult
to use—in particular, few mages can carry much with them.

## Notable Places

  - Decent names TBD

  - New Kobold trade-town
    
      - One of the Twin Cities, paired with an older, above-ground
        trading city.
      - built under world-spine mountain
      - founded \~200 years ago, growing over time
      - giant, roughly-circular cavern
      - about 9 miles across and 150 feet high
      - population of 500,000 people
      - mostly kobolds, also humans, some Dwarves and Ash Elves
      - split into blocks, built around central support spires
      - families and clans live together
      - small private spaces, large civic spaces
      - cosmopolitan trade town, sitting at intersection of major
        above-ground and underworld trade routes

  - Founding city
    
      - central fortification, surrounded by town and low-wall
      - present population of 20,000 people, large development outside
        of “old town” walls
      - historical interest, but not a major town presently (not on a
        major trade-route)
      - population composed of human, gnoll and halflings

  - Haven Isle capitol
    
      - cosmopolitan city of 300,000 people on shores of Haven Isle
        (Eastern, gulf-side)
      - heavy trade with mainland
      - above-ground (as opposed to dwarf/kobold/ash-elf construction)
      - humans, halflings, ash-elves and kobolds
      - small population of citizen Tempters

  - Three Cities
    
      - three cities under slopes of volcanic mountain on Haven Isle
      - one Ash Elf, one Kobold, one Dwarven
      - (not to be confused with the Three Cities that founded the human
        empire more than a thousand years ago)
      - total population of more than 215K
      - though the Three Cities are independent, they do share a central
        concourse and marketplace, with both surface and under-way
        access. Lots of visitors and merchants come through here.

  - Kethanel
    
      - Kethanel is a city-state located on the island Kethel in the
        gulf that separates the Orcs and Dwarves.
      - Before either the Dwarves or Orcs joined the Commonwealth,
        Kethel was settled equally by six Orcish and six Dwarven clans;
        the two shared the resources of the island—such as they were—and
        coexisted (mostly) peacefully.
      - More than 600 years ago, the Clans of Kethel met in council;
        they agreed, first, that their clan council could make decisions
        for the island as a whole, and second, that Kethel should join
        the Commonwealth, as many other Dwarven and Orcish territories
        had done.
      - Even though Kethel is more than 100 miles across, it is listed
        as a city-state, and is represented by its one major city.
        Kethanel is a city of more than thirty-five thousand situated in
        a wide bay on the continent’s Southern edge.
      - The architecture of Kethanel is striking; the city is built both
        above and below ground, and is built of massive stones carved
        and set by both Orcish and Dwarven hands. It is, not
        coincidentally, a veritable fortress.
      - Kethanel has long been a local trading and fishing hub, its role
        in trade is growing; though it has long been a port for boats
        crossing the gulf, as the Commonwealth’s sea-faring abilities
        improve, boats sailing up and around the coast from the Haven
        Isles have begun to make Kethanel a stopping-point. Some have
        whispered that a Cairn may be built in Kethanel.
      - Though Kethel is still predominantly settled by equal numbers of
        Dwarves and Orcs, after the island joined the Commonwealth it
        saw an influx of more than a thousand Gnolls, mostly of a
        unique, arctic ethnic-group; they settled in the Southeastern
        reaches of the island. More recently, Kethanel City has seen
        substantial Kobold immigration, and a small population of Ash
        Elven merchants have been carried to the city from the Haven
        Isles by boat.

## Organizations

  - Commonwealth Council organizations
    
      - Council Army / Navy / patrols
      - Council Architects: originally built and maintained roads and
        bridges, now also responsible for many large public works (f.ex.
        Dams)
      - Council Colleges: directly fund and run several colleges in
        larger towns, pay for traveling teachers to visit smaller
        communities.
      - Council Mediators: help to settle disputes between provinces;
        disputes ultimately voted on by Commonwealth Council.

  - Professional guilds
    
      - Professional guilds are a major part of the Commonwealth
        economy\!
      - Guilds provide support to tradesmen and professionals.
      - Guilds require dues from members, and work to make sure that
        members aren’t cheating the public.
      - Guilds provide support to members, helping place apprentices
        with them, and helping them make connections to other
        professionals as they travel.

  - Religious orders
    
      - usually polytheistic, help hook mortal supplicants up with any
        spirit who will make a deal
      - since spirits are usually regional, temples usually specialize
        in spirits in the region
      - some are devoted to pursuit of an idea, c.f. most orders that
        produce “paladins” or something like them

  - criminal organizations
    
      - corruption does exist, especially in big cities
      - Smugglers, black-mails, thugs, thieves, and everything else.
