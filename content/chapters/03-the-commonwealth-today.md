## <span id="anchor-8"></span>Overview

  - Present Year: CY 830

  - Commonwealth has 4 Provinces (not counting the Tribal Lands)
    
      - Heartland: original territory. The World-Spine, some territory
        East, and a large chunk West. Still a network of manors
        internally
    
      - The Haven Isles: island chain off the Western coast, featuring
        one large sub-continent island (Islandholm), and several smaller
        islands. A federalized state in the modern sense.
    
      - Northland: northern territories occupied by Dwarves, consists
        largely of the Dwarven holds that chose to join the Commonwealth
        (not all did).
    
      - Tribal Territories: large swaths of central land-mass left
        un-governed
        
          - complex relationship
          - Not a province, more an Unorganized Territory
          - Some tribes are Commonwealth members or allies, and some are
            not.
    
      - Dragonshire: Territory in the South-East, between Heartland and
        the Kingdoms of Men. Essentially a constitutional monarchy, with
        a parliamentary republican government. Where the dragons are
        from.

  - There are three major city-states
    
      - Twin Cities, old (above-ground) trade-city and new Kobold
        underground metropolis, built one-above-the-other in World Spine
        Mountains.
      - Port City situated on Southern coast of Emerald Plain
      - Royal City in Dragonshire?

  - The Commonwealth is stable and prosperous
    
      - internal trade flourishes, mediated by the river-boats, by
        halfling and human trade caravans, and by sailing along the
        coast.
    
      - The Commonwealth Council collects taxes, negotiates with
        external nations, and runs the Council organizations (like the
        Military and the Engineers).
        
          - The Council can amend the Compact, although it’s hard.
          - The Council also manages inter-province disputes.
          - Note that the Council doesn’t make law, each province does
            that for themselves.
    
      - The Commonwealth is internally stable.
        
          - The military keeps the peace.
          - People identify as Commonwealth citizens; they view this as
            important as racial or provincial identities.
    
      - well-funded professional military (internal police, army, navy)
        
          - provides a high level of security, and thus enables trade
    
      - beginnings of public school system, libraries and museums
    
      - well-maintained roads, prosperous internal trade

  - major concern is their neighbors
    
      - Long-term conflict with the Shaded Sea Peoples.
      - The Kingdom of Men is internally unstable, and could easily
        switch from being an ally to an enemy.
      - Though not at war with the Goblin Kingdoms, they have very
        little trade and no cooperation; the Kingdom is hostile, and is
        actively in conflict with an ally (the Raptor’s Alliance).

  - Internal corruption still exists
    
      - notably in cities, and notably in the Heartland Province

  - Also, the whims of the spirits are a constant source of trouble;
    though some spirits are friendly, and some others can be bought, but
    many others are both inscrutable and powerful—operating by rules
    that neither mortals nor lesser spirits understand, and willing to
    upend the affairs of lower beings for their own ends.

## <span id="anchor-9"></span>Commonwealth Technology

  - I’m bad at history, but shooting for something-like Europe in
    1200-1400.
    
      - I want them to have an impressive cultures, so I might bump that
        target year forward a little.

  - “Dark Ages” innovations occurred in Commonwealth around CY 300-500:
    
      - heavy plow, three-field rotation, yoking horses for agriculture

  - (and, of course, they can make steel, ink, paper, brick, masonry,
    ...)

  - Have invented black powder, is used in cannons
    
      - man-portable guns don’t generally exist, but
      - GM’s could introduce blunderbusses or smooth-bore muzzle-loaders
        without too much disruption

  - Commonly harness natural energy
    
      - windmills and water-wheels used to grind grain, pump water

  - Use of steam in heated baths, although not yet as an energy source
    (i.e. steam power)

  - Printing press invented 75 years ago (CY 755), society still
    adjusting from sudden surge in literature

## <span id="anchor-10"></span>Commonwealth Life, Society and Economy

  - 90% of people are farmers, living in villages of a few hundred
    people.
    
      - Most of the other people in these villages are also farmers –
        that is, not artisans, bureaucrats, traders, soldiers or
        priests.
      - Though the income of these people is marginal, they are not
        serfs—they are not owned by local nobles, at least not in the
        Commonwealth at least.
      - Many of these people know very little of the outside world, and
        will never be more than half a day’s walk from the place they
        were born.
      - Usefully for these people, the Commonwealth funds traveling
        teachers and medics. While they don’t provide anything like a
        modern education system, they do at least guarantee that most
        citizens are literate and numerate, and that they have a sketch
        idea of their own history.
      - Village farmers usually produce food for their own subsistence,
        and to feed the nearby manor to which they are associated.
      - Typically populated by a few hundred people, usually of the same
        race (owing mainly to the need to have potential mates). Most
        villages are populated by either humans or gnolls.

  - Manors are large settlements; they are scattered throughout the
    countryside.
    
      - Manors are, classically, overseen by a lord or central
        organization; though the Commonwealth has abolished formal
        serfdom, the organizations and lordly manors that founded manors
        often remain powerful and influential within their sphere.
      - Manors will be surrounded by fields, which are divided into
        plots; though each plot will usually be “owned” by a specific
        family, entire manors frequently cooperate to farm all of the
        plots, and the yield of all of the fields is often shared.
      - Manors often host local administrators and priests.
      - Manors also often host populations of artisans, often small.
      - Manors often host traders.
      - Manors can specialize in what they produce; while almost all
        manors are self-sufficient in terms of food production, some
        produce food for trade, while others have larger populations of
        artisans and produce goods for trade instead. Manors owned by
        Colleges might produce education as a type of good, while manors
        owned by monasteries or temples might prosper by trading with
        spirits or training priests.
      - Each manor is often associated with several surrounding
        villages; those villages supplement the Manor’s food production.
      - Typically have a population of two thousand or so, although this
        can vary widely. Humans and Gnolls are common in manors; drakes
        are also common in the Dragonshire.

  - Cities as such are rare, but they are more common (and stable) in
    the Commonwealth than elsewhere.
    
      - Though many cities may be surrounded by associated fields, they
        will not be (even almost) self-sufficient in terms of food
        production.
      - Cities are major trade-hubs, and are often founded on major
        trade routes—rivers or major overland routes.
      - Cities are peopled by traders, nobles, bureaucrats, priests and
        scholars—and the lower-class helpers they employ.
      - Cities will be supported by nearby manors; trade goods and food
        will flow from manors into cities, whose merchants will pass
        them on.
      - Common cities will have populations around fifteen thousand,
        though this number also varies quite widely; cities at the
        headlands of major rivers, surrounded by prosperous farm-land,
        can be significantly larger.
      - Though humans predominate in Commonwealth cities, they are
        highly diverse, and populations of many other races are common.
        Notably, Kobolds take well to urban living, and their numbers
        have been soaring over the last 200 years.

  - Major Cities
    
      - Province capitols, city-states and major port cities are *major
        cities*.
      - Major cities have populations over fifity-thousand—sometimes,
        albeit rarely, over one hundred thousand.
      - Major Cities have populations like those of cities, but are even
        larger and more prosperous; they are often the seat of province
        governments, and house the thrones of monarchs.

  - The Commonwealth includes a number of tribal societies.
    
      - Though many of them have built settlements, these tribes and
        peoples do not usually practice settled agriculture on a scale
        sufficient to support their societies.
      - Frequently, their able-bodied adult population ranges through
        nearby lands, hunting and foraging.
      - Some will practice shepherding; those wandering will herd
        flocks.
      - The very old, the very young, priests and artisans will live in
        their settlements, supported by smaller-scale agriculture.
      - Unlike cities, manors and villages, the borders of tribal
        territories will frequently be poorly-defined; they will be
        surrounded by great tracts of wilderness, left unspoiled by the
        other Commonwealth societies.
      - Though many tribal societies have signed the Commonwealth
        charter, and thus their members are properly Commonwealth
        citizens, they are frequently fairly isolated; they usually do
        not produce excesses of food or goods for trade, and therefore
        do not attract traders or travelers. Most simply continue to
        live as they have always lived.
      - Notably, not all tribal societies within the Commonwealth’s
        borders are members of the Commonwealth; Orks, in particular,
        have never been peacefully incorporated. These societies are
        often isolated; Commonwealth forts will ring their territory,
        Commonwealth soldiers will patrol their borders, and though they
        are left free, they will be trapped within their territories.

  - Trading Caravans
    
      - A way of life common to Halflings, Trade Caravans were vital to
        tying the early Commonwealth together; as conduits of trade,
        they were major vehicles of its prosperity.
      - Somewhat similar to tribal communities, halfling commuities are
        *dimorphic*: the able-bodied journey with the caravans, while
        the young, old and infirm live in settlements similar to small
        manors.
      - Halfling communities typically rely on villages and manors of
        other races to provide them with food; they are more likely to
        profit from trade or artisanry.

  - Underground Societies
    
      - Several commonwealth races—notably Kobolds and Ash Elves—prefer
        to live underground.
      - Subterranean cultures typically live in larger cities: tunneling
        through rock is more labor-intensive than clearing open land,
        and farming underground is impractical, so there is little
        incentive to scatter into countless villages.
      - Unsurprisingly, mining is often a primary economic activity for
        subterranean cultures.
      - They also often support large populations of artisans.
      - They support themselves by trading ore and finished goods with
        surface-dwelling peoples.

  - I was fairly drunk towards the end of this, so I need to go back and
    look this over.

## <span id="anchor-11"></span>Commonwealth Governance

  - Move/expand above information here.

  - One feature of New Charter is that the Commonwealth can collect
    taxes from its provinces, which the Commonwealth Council can use to
    fund whatever operations they elect to (as opposed to specifically
    funding the patrols and roads under the Compact).
    
      - This has lead to several new Commonwealth Council organizations.

  - One major such organization is the military.
    
      - The Commonwealth has the known world’s preeminent military.
      - Their prosperity allows them to fund a permanent, professional
        military.
      - This military actively patrols their interior and guards their
        frontiers.
      - The security provided by their armed forces allows trade to
        flourish, and the might of their military substantially prevents
        attack by competing societies.
      - Gnolls are a major race in the Commonwealth military, where
        their physical strength and endurance provide a formidable
        advantage over primarily Human, Shade Elf or Goblinoid armies.
      - Kobolds have also found a place within the Commonwealth’s
        armies, where their speed, tough hides and small size can make
        them useful infiltrators, raiders, scouts and spies.

  - Hmm. This section might be redundant to information in the
    Commonwealth Today and Organizations sections; I might also not want
    to go on at length about this. Possibly rework.

## <span id="anchor-12"></span>Commonwealth Magic

Though the spirits are often inscrutable and the potential applications
for magic are vast, it is nevertheless true that the sages and scholars
of the Commonwealth have amassed a vast amount of useful knowledge of
magic, and that much of this knowledge has been deployed to the benefit
of the Commonwealth. It is studied in their universities, deployed in
their military, and sold in their cities by clerics and hedge-wizards.
While powerful magic items (e.g. magical weapons and armor) are rare,
simple magical tools and potions are common (see *Items* for a few
examples, by no means complete\!).

Of special note is the recently-developed Kairne Network. Each Kairne is
an unassuming stack of standing-stones, surrounded by an open space and
paced out by smaller Kairnes arranged in a circle. These unassuming
ritual-sights allow magic-users who know how to use them to rapidly
transport themselves from any one Kairne to any other—allowing them to
cover great distances in the blink of an eye. Presently, only a dozen
Kairnes have been constructed, and the Kairne networks remain difficult
to use—in particular, few mages can carry much with them.

## <span id="anchor-13"></span>Notable Places

  - Decent names TBD

  - New Kobold trade-town
    
      - One of the Twin Cities, paired with an older, above-ground
        trading city.
      - built under world-spine mountain
      - founded \~200 years ago, growing over time
      - giant, roughly-circular cavern
      - about 9 miles across and 150 feet high
      - population of 500,000 people
      - mostly kobolds, also humans, some Dwarves and Ash Elves
      - split into blocks, built around central support spires
      - families and clans live together
      - small private spaces, large civic spaces
      - cosmopolitan trade town, sitting at intersection of major
        above-ground and underworld trade routes

  - Founding city
    
      - central fortification, surrounded by town and low-wall
      - present population of 20,000 people, large development outside
        of “old town” walls
      - historical interest, but not a major town presently (not on a
        major trade-route)
      - population composed of human, gnoll and halflings

  - Haven Isle capitol
    
      - cosmopolitan city of 300,000 people on shores of Haven Isle
        (Eastern, gulf-side)
      - heavy trade with mainland
      - above-ground (as opposed to dwarf/kobold/ash-elf construction)
      - humans, halflings, ash-elves and kobolds
      - small population of citizen Tempters

  - Three Cities
    
      - three cities under slopes of volcanic mountain on Haven Isle
      - one Ash Elf, one Kobold, one Dwarven
      - (not to be confused with the Three Cities that founded the human
        empire more than a thousand years ago)
      - total population of more than 215K
      - though the Three Cities are independent, they do share a central
        concourse and marketplace, with both surface and under-way
        access. Lots of visitors and merchants come through here.

  - Kethanel
    
      - Kethanel is a city-state located on the island Kethel in the
        gulf that separates the Orcs and Dwarves.
      - Before either the Dwarves or Orcs joined the Commonwealth,
        Kethel was settled equally by six Orcish and six Dwarven clans;
        the two shared the resources of the island—such as they were—and
        coexisted (mostly) peacefully.
      - More than 600 years ago, the Clans of Kethel met in council;
        they agreed, first, that their clan council could make decisions
        for the island as a whole, and second, that Kethel should join
        the Commonwealth, as many other Dwarven and Orcish territories
        had done.
      - Even though Kethel is more than 100 miles across, it is listed
        as a city-state, and is represented by its one major city.
        Kethanel is a city of more than thirty-five thousand situated in
        a wide bay on the continent’s Southern edge.
      - The architecture of Kethanel is striking; the city is built both
        above and below ground, and is built of massive stones carved
        and set by both Orcish and Dwarven hands. It is, not
        coincidentally, a veritable fortress.
      - Kethanel has long been a local trading and fishing hub, its role
        in trade is growing; though it has long been a port for boats
        crossing the gulf, as the Commonwealth’s sea-faring abilities
        improve, boats sailing up and around the coast from the Haven
        Isles have begun to make Kethanel a stopping-point. Some have
        whispered that a Cairn may be built in Kethanel.
      - Though Kethel is still predominantly settled by equal numbers of
        Dwarves and Orcs, after the island joined the Commonwealth it
        saw an influx of more than a thousand Gnolls, mostly of a
        unique, arctic ethnic-group; they settled in the Southeastern
        reaches of the island. More recently, Kethanel City has seen
        substantial Kobold immigration, and a small population of Ash
        Elven merchants have been carried to the city from the Haven
        Isles by boat.

## <span id="anchor-14"></span>Organizations

  - Commonwealth Council organizations
    
      - Council Army / Navy / patrols
      - Council Architects: originally built and maintained roads and
        bridges, now also responsible for many large public works (f.ex.
        Dams)
      - Council Colleges: directly fund and run several colleges in
        larger towns, pay for traveling teachers to visit smaller
        communities.
      - Council Mediators: help to settle disputes between provinces;
        disputes ultimately voted on by Commonwealth Council.

  - Professional guilds
    
      - Professional guilds are a major part of the Commonwealth
        economy\!
      - Guilds provide support to tradesmen and professionals.
      - Guilds require dues from members, and work to make sure that
        members aren’t cheating the public.
      - Guilds provide support to members, helping place apprentices
        with them, and helping them make connections to other
        professionals as they travel.

  - Religious orders
    
      - usually polytheistic, help hook mortal supplicants up with any
        spirit who will make a deal
      - since spirits are usually regional, temples usually specialize
        in spirits in the region
      - some are devoted to pursuit of an idea, c.f. most orders that
        produce “paladins” or something like them

  - criminal organizations
    
      - corruption does exist, especially in big cities
      - Smugglers, black-mails, thugs, thieves, and everything else.

## <span id="anchor-15"></span>Languages

  - The Commonwealth is wide and diverse, including countless small
    regional cultures; it includes a rich multitude of languages.
    
      - Languages tend to correspond to *cultures* rather than *races,*
        and cultures tend to be regional: a given wood elf is likely to
        speak a language that is similar to (and influenced by) the
        other nearby cultures with (whom they have regular contact), and
        that language is likely to be totally dissimilar to the language
        spoken by another wood elf living a thousand miles away (with
        whom they have almost no contact).
      - Note that, before the internet, before the railroad, in the
        early days of the printing press, languages tended to be small
        and local, and they tended to be relatively fluid.

  - Things are complicated by the fact that many races cannot make the
    same sounds as one-another.
    
      - For example, Gnolls and Humans cannot physically make the same
        sounds, and so they cannot speak one-another’s languages.
      - It is common for people in mixed communities to have some
        fluency in their neighbor’s languages—even if they cannot
        actually *speak* that language.

Language Rules

  - Creatures can have one, two or three dots in a language.
    
      - If they have one dot in a language, they have a basic ability to
        speak it; they can understand and communicate basic concepts,
        and can make themselves understood with some effort.
      - If they have two dots in a language, they have conversational
        fluency; they can comfortably hold a conversation in that
        language, although they may have an accent, be missing some
        uncommon vocabulary or occasionally mangle an idiom.
      - If they have three dots in a language, they have native fluency;
        either they are native speakers, or they have mastered the
        language to an equivalent degree.

  - Any given creature can only speak certain languages (except some
    particularly gifted mimics).
    
      - Each creature (that can speak) has one or more *language
        groups*; these represent the sounds that they can make.
      - Each language also has one (or more, in rare cases) language
        group, representing the sounds that are required in order to
        speak it.
      - A character can learn (that is, purchase dots for) any language,
        and
      - a character can read, write and understand any language that
        they have dots in, but
      - they can only (physically) speak a language that they have the
        languages groups for.
      - See also the *Torque of Speaking* in Magic Items.

  - Sometimes, communicating is difficult;
    
      - this can be the situation if you are trying to understand a
        language that is different than but *mutually intelligible* with
        your own, or it might be because your character lacks native
        proficiency in a given language. In these cases, you can use an
        INT×3 check to see if your character can communicate
        effectively.
      - Note that checks are usually only appropriate when it is
        important to communicate a complex concept, and when limited
        time is available to communicate. In cases where characters have
        time to talk with one another, you may assume that any
        reasonable concept can eventually be communicated.

Common Language Groups

  - HHED: the sounds that humans, halflings, elves and dwarves can make
  - GR: the sounds that Gnolls and Ratfolk can make (commonly described
    as “several coyotes having seizures”)
  - DDK: the sounds that Dragons, Drakes and Kobolds can make (commonly
    described as “a rasping song-bird”)

Example Languages, Rare and Common:

  - Commonwealth Standard
    
      - Group: Any
    
      - Commonwealth Standard represents a partially-successful attempt
        at a universal language.
    
      - When speaking, Commonwealth Standard uses a small set of
        abstract sounds, designed to be very distinct. For each abstract
        sound, each speaker picks one sound that they can make and
        substitutes it.
    
      - This at best kind-of works; it is difficult to speak and
        understand Commonwealth Standard, since any given speaker might
        use different substitute sounds than any other.
    
      - However, as a *written *language, Commonwealth Standard is a
        huge success.
    
      - Commonwealth Standard is the almost-universal written language
        for governing documents, contracts, trade and scholarship—even
        in the Kingdoms of Man, most merchants, administrators and
        elites can read and write Commonwealth Standard.
    
      - Most formal education uses texts in Commonwealth Standard;
        because of this, more people can read and write in Commonwealth
        Standard than in their own language.
    
      - Names in Commonwealth Standard tend to be combinations of words,
        so that they can be translated.
        
          - A Human telling a Kobold that their name is “Anden” is
            pointless if the Kobold cannot make any of those sounds.
            “Quicksmith” is at least translatable.
    
      - Commonwealth often forms new words by combining existing words
        together:
        
          - the word that we are translating as “Plane,” for example,
            consists of the words “Great” and “Land” combined together.
    
      - Note that almost no-one has Commonwealth Standard as their
        native language; that’s almost always a regional or cultural
        language. However, some ability to speak Commonwealth Standard
        as a second language is common.

  - Chatter: the language of the Warren Isles.
    
      - Chatter, as it has been not-entirely-kindly named, is the
        indigenous language of the Ratfolk of the Warren Isles.
      - Chatter is not commonly spoken in the Commonwealth; most of the
        Commonwealth’s Ratfolk now speak Cqik.
      - This in turn has meant that Chatter has become one of the common
        languages of crime in the Haven Isles—as the language is only
        commonly spoken by the Ratfolk of the Shaded Sea Peoples and
        their criminal and piratical allies.

  - Cqik: the language of the Commonwealth’s Ratfolk
    
      - The name “Cqik” is derived from a somewhat famous—or
        infamous—letter that was written by a Kingdoms-of-Men diplomat
        visiting the Haven Isles; she attempted to describe what she
        thought a Ratfolk merchant sounded like, and “Cqik” is a
        transliteration from her Royal to Islander. The name is widely
        pronounced “kweek” (although some Ratfolk put visitors through
        something of an initiation by writing out “Cqik” in the Islander
        alphabet—which is almost the same as Weal’s—and cajoling them
        into trying to pronounce it).
      - Though Cqik is commonly spoken by Ratfolk living among the
        Commonwealth, it actually inherits more from Heartland Gnoll
        than from Chatter. When Ratfolk refugees settled in the Haven
        Isles, many of them learned Gnollish as a second language; the
        language of the much larger gnollish population eventually
        supplanted much of the Chatter that the Ratfolk had carried with
        them.

  - Heartland Gnoll: a language commonly spoken by Gnolls in Heartland
    Province.
    
      - Heartland Gnoll is a derivative of the language spoke by the
        Gnoll tribe that helped found the Commonwealth. As that tribe’s
        fortunes grew, as they founded new cities and towns and became a
        people, they spread their language and cemented its place as the
        language peace and prosperity among those spoken by Gnolls.
      - Over centuries of close contact, Heartland Gnoll has absorbed
        many idioms from Weal.
      - Though Heartland Gnoll is far and away the most common Gnollish
        language, many other tribal languages still survive.

  - Hel: common language in Northland, influenced by both Hud and Weal.
    
      - Hel is a language that has sprung up in Northland province,
        combing bits of both Weal (as spoken by the humans and halflings
        among the early Commonwealth settlers) and Hud (an older Dwarven
        language spoken by most of the Dwarven clans).
      - Though originally regarded as something of a vulgar language, it
        has since become ubiquitous in Northland province; many today
        view the unique, common language of their thinly-populated
        province with pride.

  - High Kobold: language used by Kobolds in the Commonwealth.
    
      - High Kobold is derived from Old Kobold, but has become far more
        complex. It has imported many words directly from Rak, and has
        borrowed idioms from Weal and, more recently, Islander Elvish.
      - High Kobold has grown to include countless neologisms—new words
        for things that Kobolds never encountered as an oppressed and
        impoverished population in the Kingdoms of Men.
      - Many kobolds find it somewhat amusing that some of the
        birdsong-like sounds they use strike other races as musical; as
        a result, High Kobold has come to include some idioms selected
        specifically for their lyrical quality.

  - Hud: a traditional Dwarven language, common in Northland Province.
    
      - Hud is an older Dwarven language, dating back more than a
        thousand years.
      - Though Hud is still a widely-known language, it is not widely
        used for conversation; most Dwarven clans have their own
        idiomatic languages, influenced by their history and neighbors
        (though many are mutually intelligible with Hud, to a greater or
        lesser extent).
      - Hud is mainly used as a formal language, for interaction between
        clans (whose languages might not be mutually intelligible with
        each other), and for liturgy and ritual (which might be
        ancient).

  - Islander Elvish: commonly spoken by the Ash Elves living on Haven
    Isle
    
      - Islander Elvish is a complex hybrid language, derived from the
        many languages carried to the Haven Isles by wood and shade
        elves and heavily influenced by Weal (as spoken by human and
        halfling settlers) and even Hel (as spoken by the dwarven
        settlements in Islandholme).

  - Islander: common language on the Haven Isles, influenced by Islander
    Elvish and Weal.
    
      - Islander is a language commonly spoken on the Haven Isles; it is
        a derivative of Weal, though it has borrowed heavily from the
        disordered synthesis of elven languages that is Islander Elven.

  - Keillou: the language of the Shade Elves.
    
      - Keillou is a common language spoken throughout Shade Elven
        territory. It is primarily the language of the Shade Elves, but
        it has also been adopted by many of their tributaries.
      - The Shaded Sea Peoples—the Shade Elves, the Ratfolk of the
        Warren Isles and the Leapers—cannot share a language with
        one-another, and the shade elves are not inclined to learn the
        languages of their tributaries, so Keillou has had few foreign
        influences.
      - The Shade Elves themselves primarily speak a few specific
        dialects of Keillou; in turn, something of a vulgar keillou has
        sprung up, which has been influenced by the languages of some of
        the shade elves’ tributaries.

  - Rak: a language spoken by Dragons and Drakes in the Dragonshire
    
      - Dragons have never had a large population, and they can speak
        with few other languages—kobolds were the only race commonly
        found on the Emerald Plane that could make the same sounds that
        they could. Rak was long an ancient, unique language that
        Dragons used only to communicate among themselves.
      - Though dragons are small in number, they are also extremely
        long-lived; this means that each individual dragon would
        frequently accumulate a library of unique idioms, quirks and
        turns-of-phrase. At one time, there were as many dialects of Rak
        as there were dragons.
      - All of this changed with the founding of the Dragonshire, with
        Karrach’s call for other dragons to settle in the Dragonshire
        and especially with the creation of the Drakes.
      - Rak became the common language of the Dragonshire’s nobility—of
        the dragons that led the nation as monarchs and the Drakes who
        served as their nobles and administrators.
      - Over years in common usage, it has become more regular—and, as
        it was used as a written language of formal contract by the
        merchants of the Dragonshire, it has become somewhat more
        formal.
      - Rak is still widely spoken by the drakes and dragons of the
        Dragonshire.

  - Royal: a common language in the Kingdoms of Men.
    
      - Royal is derived from Old Imperial, though it has been
        dramatically altered by the intervening thousand years of
        history.
      - Royal has been somewhat resistant to influences from other
        languages, in part because such borrowlings are viewed dimly by
        some in Kingdoms, especially in the eastern Kingdoms
        (unsurprisingly). This also means that there are noticeable
        differences between regional dialects, especially between the
        eastern and western Kingdoms.

  - Vulgar Goblin: a language used by the lower ranks of the Goblin
    Kingdom.
    
      - Goblins can produce a wide array of sounds, and their languages
        typically employ all of them; this makes it a practical
        impossibility for members of most other races to speak a goblin
        language.
      - Vulgar Goblin is a clipped and fluid dialect of an older
        Goblinoid language, used by the lower ranks of the Goblin
        Kingdom.
      - It has been influenced by the languages of the peoples that
        goblins took as slaves—by the languages of humans, elves and
        gnolls, among others.
      - It is distinct from Royal Goblin, the language of the Goblin
        kings; this language has resisted influences from those taken as
        slaves, but has in turn been influenced by the structure of
        Commonwealth Standard.

  - Weal: a common language in Heartland Province.
    
      - Weal is a widely heterogeneous language. It is derived from Old
        Imperial, the language of the humans who built the Empire, but
        it has since been heavily influenced by the many languages that
        the Commonwealth has encountered and peacefully absorbed as it
        spread across the Emerald Plane.
      - Weal—or some regional dialect thereof—is commonly spoken
        throughout Heartland and Westward Provinces.
      - Notably, Weal was carried throughout the Emerald Plane by early
        Commonwealth settlers, and has itself become the root from which
        several other, newer languages where derived; it is still
        mutually-intelligible with some of them, like Hel.

  - Old Imperial: the language that the Empire carried west.
    
      - Old Imperial was the language of the Empire, carried West from
        the coast towards the World’s-Spine Mountains by imperial
        settlers.
      - In the millennium since those days, Old Imperial has died out;
        while some scholars of the ancient past can still understand it,
        it is all but gone as a living language.
      - Both Weal and Royal are descended from it, although they are
        very different languages from it and from one another—Weal in
        particular is greatly changed from Old Imperial.
      - Old Imperial is notable for its aspirated H’s and hard
        consonants.

  - Old Kobold: the original Kobold language, spoken in their ancestral
    home in Imperial territory.
    
      - Old Kobold was spoken by the Kobold populations that resided
        within the Kingdoms of Men.
      - Old Kobold passed away with the near-extinction of the
        populations that spoke it.
      - Some Kobold populations still survive in the western portion of
        the Kingdoms; Old Kobold can still be heard there.
