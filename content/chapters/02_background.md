The continent

  - Takes place on large northern-hemisphere continent (the Emerald
    Plain).
    
      - Named for how heavily forested it is.
      - “Forrest's Spine” range in middle, two long plains sloping to
        sea on either side
      - alt: World’s Spine or Worldspine. Need a better name than
        Forrest Spine.

  - Large island chain off to the West (The Haven Isles), of which
    Islandholm is the largest (and Islandholm is very large).
    
      - Change from last revision: Haven Isles are a chain, of which
        Islandholme is the largest. Editing is required.

  - Third continent approaching from the South. No land bridge yet,
    large gulf (about 900km); only recently able to cross it.
    
      - The Raptor’s Plane
      - Possible geography: heavy jungle in the West and center, desert
        in the East.
      - might pick a different name referencing their feathers and
        plumage.
      - The average North-South distance of the Mediterranean sea is
        800km, I used that as a guide. Although I might prefer it to be
        bigger.

  - (I wanted to avoid being Fantasy America or Fantasy Europe right
    from the beginning, so I tried to get geography that didn’t line up
    with either. I did an imperfect job.)

Distant History

  - Humans first to build cities, develop settled agriculture

  - Human city-states rise up on shores of rivers, flowing east from
    World’s Spine to sea

  - Spread quickly, crossing World’s Spine. Penetrate territories of
    other pre-settled races and peoples

  - Humans found an Empire
    
      - empire run from and for the three major city-states (all in the
        Eastern-most region of the continent, on rivers flowing from the
        World’s Spine to the sea)
      - “Roman Style”: the rest of the Empire is conquered territory,
        administered for the benefit of citizens of the Three Cities.

  - Spreads too far:
    
      - distant colonies become as large and prosperous as the Three
        Cities, but too far away to control
      - Empire sends small populations of its citizens to rule distant
        territories; exports knowledge, culture and language

  - Dragon Karrach leads rebellion. Claims foothills on Eastern side of
    world-spine, cuts off most of the Empire's territory from Three
    Cities (\~150 years before first Charter—so, 150+75=225 years before
    CY 0?)

  - Former Imperial territory continues to grow, but suffers power
    vacuum.

  - Dawn of the Commonwealth: Gnollish refugees, fleeing a purge in
    their own tribe, seek shelter in a human village, and are granted
    refuge and nearby Manor.

Commonwealth History

  - The charter that granted Gnolls a manor becomes an important
    document governing trade

  - Society benefits from strength of Gnolls

  - Bolstered by Gnolls, patrols secure countryside; trade flourishes,
    more manors founded.
    
      - “first charter” is used to administer relations between manors
        and city
      - it works but is unwieldy – it was never intended to build the
        government for a nation.

  - Eastern Empire collapses, an event nobody else cares about

  - 75 years later, New Charter replaces Old Charter: formally builds
    Charter Council.
    
      - New Charter is actually designed as a governing document
      - Any manor that signs the Charter is a member of the Commonwealth
      - “league of city-states” type arrangement: each Manor and City is
        still a “law unto itself”
      - The year the New Charter is signed is Charter Year 0 (CY 0)
      - Commonwealth Council cannot make law: all they do is tax trade,
        and use money to fund Army and maintain Roads
      - over next \~700 years, powers and missions expand, but are
        constrained by terms of charter. For example, some public
        schools opened, but run under road-building power, officially
        for the purpose of training engineers to build roads, bridges
        and dams.

  - Expand and flourish: cross World’s Spine mountains
    
      - other races (mostly) peacefully integrated: the manorial system
        is flexible, they’re simple granted manors.
      - Some Tribal Races refuse to integrate: the Commonwealth simply
        flows around their territories.
      - This does leave large swathes of unclaimed territories in the
        middle of the continent (the “Tribal Lands”, where tribal
        cultures still exist)

  - Feudalism takes root in territories of the Old Empire, Kingdoms
    built
    
      - This will give rise to the Kingdoms of Men, a messy web of small
        Kingdoms.

  - First manor on the Western side of the World Spine signs charter in
    CY 91.

  - Dwarves encountered in the North in CY 103.

  - In CY 325, the Western coast is reached; in CY 350, the Haven Isles
    are reached, and Islandholm is settled.

  - CY 350, Karrach surrenders power of nobility, Dragonshire governed
    by “house of commons”

  - In CY 447, Shaded Sea People attack Islandholme and occupy it –
    briefly. Commonwealth counter-attack is devastating, liberating
    island twenty days later and shattering the forces of the houses
    that mounted it.
    
      - Surviving Shade Elves are imprisoned in short term, slowly
        integrated into Commonwealth society. Ash elves are their
        descendants

  - CY 600, Kobolds flee genocide in eastern portion of Human Kingdoms;
    peacefully incorporated into Commonwealth
    
      - Many settle in World’s Spine mountains, many more continue to
        the Haven Isles.
      - Many probably settle in the Dragonshire, which sits between the
        Commonwealth and Kingdoms and has a large population that can
        speak their languages.

  - CY 750, Commonwealth Compact replaces Commonwealth Charter
    
      - The Commonwealth no works like a league of nations.
    
      - Commonwealth territory split into Provinces and City-States:
        
          - each province organizes itself
          - city-states are independent of provinces, have their own
            top-level status.
    
      - The Commonwealth Council still can’t make law, but it has
        broader funding powers – no longer just armies and civil
        engineers, can now undertake civil projects (like schools)
        directly
    
      - Dragonshire formally incorporated as a Province (it was an
        independent allied nation)
    
      - Clay Men formally incorporated (where formerly and allied
        people)
    
      - The Herders and their alliance are formally incorporated (they
        where also an allied people).
    
      - Commonwealth Compact has an “enumeration of freedoms” that each
        Province (and each Manor) must provide.
