# <span id="anchor-90"></span>Senses, Movements and Special Abilities

The following are common Senses, Movement types and Special Abilities.
This list is by no means exhaustive.

## <span id="anchor-91"></span>Senses

  - Normal: the normal senses that humans have

  - Blind-Sight: you have the ability to sense your surroundings, even
    when you cannot see; this might be a result of the heightening of
    your other sense, it might be a mechanism like a bat’s sonar, or it
    might be a supernatural ability. Even in conditions of total
    darkness, you can perceive your environment, including any object
    larger than a human fist, out to a distance of 30m. You cannot
    perceive color or fine detail. Perception tests made with
    Blind-Sight suffer a -20 penalty.
    
      - This is more like D\&D Dark-Vision than I wanted it to be; I did
        not want to add off-brand Dark Vision.

  - Infra-red: you can see in infra-red. This is particularly useful at
    night.

  - Low-Light: creature can see clearly in low-light conditions (but not
    total darkness).

  - Mage-Sight: you can perceive magical energy. You can see active
    magical effects, and you can attempt to determine what a magical
    effect is by studying it (a 10 minute task action, requiring an
    appropriate Knowledge check).

  - Scent: you have an extremely keen sense of smell. This allows you to
    detect many sneaking creatures, and to identify things by smell.

  - Tremor-sense: when in contact with a solid object, you can sense
    vibrations propagating through it. This allows you to sens
    approaching footfalls through the ground, for example.

## <span id="anchor-92"></span>Movement Modes

General Rules:

  - Creatures have several different movement modes.

  - Most movement modes list *walking* and *running* rates
    
      - see *Combat* for rules about movement rates in combat.

  - Some movement modes also list a *maximum speed*, which is the
    maximum speed allowed for that movement mode.
    
      - We don’t have detailed rules for acceleration; as a rough guide,
        for movement modes with a maximum speed, you can add either your
        Walking or Running rate to your current speed in any given turn.

  - Most movement modes have a *linked skill*, which is used for tests
    regarding that movement mode. Tests are usually called for when
    difficult maneuvers are made (such as running across a slick
    surface), when attempting to *sprint* (see *Combat*) or as opposed
    tests during *chase scenes*.
    
      - Most movement modes, including Walking movement, use the
        Athletics skill.
      - Flying movement use the Flying skill.
      - Mounted movement uses the Riding skill.
      - Other movements mode, such as Burrowing movement, use the Exotic
        Movement skill.

Movement Modes:

  - Burrowing: you can burrow through the ground. You can choose to
    leave a tunnel behind you or not. Some soil, such as hard or rocky
    soil, cannot be burrowed through. If you have Burrowing as a
    movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while burrowing.
    
      - Linked to Exotic Movement: Burrowing

  - Climbing: you can climb as easily as humans can walk. Note that some
    creatures can’t climb some surfaces (someone that climbs with claws,
    like a cat, cannot climb on glass or metal, for example).
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

  - Flying: you can fly.
    
      - Linked to the Flying skill.

  - Leaping: you move in a series of hops, like a kangaroo or frog.
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.
      - Less hindered by broken group or small gaps

  - Swimming: you can swim as easily as humans can walk. If you have a
    Swim movement mode, you can be assumed to breath while underwater
    (presuming you need to breathe).
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

  - Walking: bipedal movement.
    
      - Linked to the Athletics skill.

## <span id="anchor-93"></span>Abilities

  - Fast Healing: when you have Fast Healing *k*, you reduce your Damage
    by *k* each turn – normally healing by 20 \* *k* a minute. Every
    day, you may recover from one wound (what it might look like
    half-way through this process is best not thought about).
  - Motion-Sensitive: your senses are particularly sensitive to motion.
    You receive a +10 bonus to Perception checks made against moving
    targets.

## <span id="anchor-94"></span>Sizes

  - The affects of being a different size are generally not represented
    mechanically (i.e. there is no “size modifier table”).
  - Being *small *or *large* might confer bonuses in some situations,
    such as making it easier (if small) or harder (if large) to use
    Stealth; these are at the GM’s discretion.
  - See also *Sizes* in Combat.
