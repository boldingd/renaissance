## Races

There are three separate keywords that have special significance in Race
entries. All races will have one of the following keywords: Natural,
Supernatural or Spirit. This tells you whether the race is
flesh-and-blood (Natural), has some inborn supernatural quality
(Supernatural), or is composed entirely of magical energy (Spirit).

Some races have optional Traits, Classes, Powers or Backgrounds. You
don't acquire them for free; rather, they are added to your list of
options at character creation, and you may _optionally_ select them
using all the normal rules for taking Traits, Classes, Powers or
Backgrounds during character creation. (So, for example, Shifters don't
_just have _the Animal Form trait, but they can purchase it during
character creation for CP, just like any other trait they are eligible
for.)

Game Design Note: narrowing the stuff you get in Races down to _only_
what every member of that species would have, regardless of background.
Moving other features (c.f. skill bonuses) to backgrounds. Adding
Optional Backgrounds to races that have unique sub-cultures (like Ash
Elves, Herders or Dwarves).

Game Design Note: races selection should be interesting, and should
affect how you play the character. However, you shouldn't have to pick a
specific race to get a specific feature or be good at a specific job.
This is why many abilities were moved to Backgrounds, and why many
abilities are being replaced by Traits-for-free (so that any other Race
can just take the Trait if they want to).

## Common Races

### Ash Elves

-   The first Ash Elves where the descendants of Shade Elves captured in
    the siege of Islandholme, who then interbred with Wood Elves.

    -   Their communities have also absorbed Shade Elves fleeing the
        Shaded Sea, and Wood Elves looking seeking an urban life.

-   They remain very aware of their history. Most can tell the story of
    how their ancestors came to the Commonwealth---of the ancestor who
    was captured after the siege of Islandholme and had to integrate
    into a strange, new culture, or of fleeing some change in Shade
    Elven lands to take shelter in the Commonwealth.

    -   Many of them are also aware of the horrors present in the Shaded
        Sea today.

-   The Ash Elves have formed a deeply philosophical culture; in their
    past, they were avid students of the law, political writing and
    philosophy of other cultures, and in their present, they have become
    major producers of law and philosophy.

    -   They are a very mindful culture in particular, and the practice
        of meditation is common.
    -   They have formed a highly egalitarian and open culture, and
        today are maor advocates for greater Commonwealth unity and it's
        continued benevolent development.
    -   Because of this, members of other races often view Ash Elves as
        natural judges, and defer to their judgment in conflict.
    -   This can be for better or worse: most Ash Elves quickly consume
        a wide variety of literature, making them well but eclectically
        read; because of this, their personal philosophies can vary
        widely.

-   Ash Elves tend to prefer urban settlements, and Ash Elven can be
    found throughout the Commonwealth's major cities.

    -   They have also build their own cities and towns, most located
        either in the Haven Isles or on the Western shores of the
        Emerald Plane.
    -   They tend to build large communities underground, somewhat like
        Dwarves and Kobolds.
    -   They tend to be very open towards outsiders; they are widely
        known for joyous public celebrations that mark major holidays,
        in which they welcome outsiders, travelers and members of
        neighboring communities.

-   They are known for the quality of their artistry; their buildings,
    homes and settlements will often feature prominent art-pieces.
-   Ash Elves look much like humans, except for their fine features,
    their elegant and pointed ears, and their ash-grey skin.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 250 years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   _Stoic_: Ash Elves can negate one Trauma
-   _Keen Senses_: Ash Elves receive +20 to visual Perception checks,
    and +10 to auditory perception checks.

-   Optional Trait: Meditation.

    -   Most Ash Elves study meditation all their lives, and can
        maintain their discipline in the direst of circumstances. When
        making a Control check, the Ash Elf ignores penalties from
        Wounds, Traumas and Distractions.

-   Optional Background: Ash-Elf Traditional

    -   10 ranks in the Control skill
    -   10 ranks in one Art skill and one Technical skill of your choice
    -   You gain the Meditation optional trait (you do not have to
        purchase it separately if you choose this back-ground)

### Drakes

-   Descendants of Dragons interbreeding with Humans in the territories
    of the former Empire that were claimed by the red dragon Karrack

    -   NB: I don't want "humans can interbreed with everything else"
        to be a thing; presumably, this worked with Dragons because
        Dragons are already shape-shifters.

-   In the early days of the Dragonshire, when they were a feudal
    territory (and most of the feudal lords were dragons), Drakes tended
    to take positions of authority, above Humans but below pure-blooded
    Dragons.
-   As political reforms took place, the role of Drakes, Dragons and
    Human leaders changed. The modern Dragonshire is a Commonwealth
    province, and power has been devolved from the hereditary nobility
    (of Drakes and Dragons) to civil Councils.
-   Still, Drakes largely think of themselves as being of "noble blood",
    and many of them still hold hereditary titles -- which may or may
    not be of practical significance.
-   Even though power in the Dragonshire has been devolved to civil
    councils, having the right lineage still helps: Drakes commonly hold
    positions of privilege and authority in the Dragonshire.
-   Because their culture is similar to that of the feudal Kingdoms of
    Man, Drakes find it fairly easy to interact politically with that
    neighboring state.
-   Drakes commonly serve in units of the Commonwealth Military that
    draw from the citizenry of the Dragonshire
-   Somewhat like Gnolls, Drakes also commonly take up jobs where their
    immense strength is an asset. However, because Drakes are much more
    comfortable in large cities, this tends to mean "blacksmithing" more
    often than it means "farm work".
-   Drakes tend to be good-natured and sociable at best, but also brash,
    proud and stubborn at worst.
-   Appearance: Drakes are humanoid in gross layout, but they have the
    head, long tail, powerfil limbs, tough scales and sharp claws of
    Dragons. So maybe it's better to say they look like Dragons, except
    for being roughly humanoid in shape.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 100 Years
    -   Average Height: 2.4m
    -   Average Weight: 110kg

-   The descendants of Dragons and Humanoids, forming the hereditary
    upper-class of the Dragonshire.

-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Dragon-Kin, Drake
-   Language Group: DDK, HHED
-   Scales: +2 Armor

-   Optional Trait: Chroma

    -   Though Drakes come in vibrant colors and hues, most have no
        inherited the particular magical natures of Dragons; you,
        however, have.
    -   You gain resistance to one of the following: Chemical, Cold,
        Disease, Electricity or Fire.

-   Optional Trait: Dragon's Flight

    -   Dragons have a wide variety of modes of motion, and you have
        inherited one of them.
    -   You gain one of the following movement modes: Swim 3 / 15,
        Burrow 2 / 6, Fly 3 / 15 / 45

-   Optional Power: Breath Weapon

    -   You have inherited the ability to breathe fire---or some other
        dangerous substance.
    -   This power has a Type. If you took the Chroma trait, then its
        type is the one you chose for your resistance; otherwise, the
        type is Fire.
    -   You gain one of the following effects, depending on the power's
        type:

        -   Chemical: you can spit a toxic spray. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, Splash 1D10 รท 3 m. Range 10m
            short / 20m long. Tags: Natural, Chemical. Covered opponents
            suffer 1D10 รท 2 DV a turn; the chemical can be washed off
            with water (a standard action requiring a source of water).
        -   Cold: you can hurl an icy spear. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -4. Tags:
            Natural, Cold, Ice
        -   Disease: You can launch a small bundle of bone-like spines
            infected with a deadly plague. You gain the following
            attack: Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10 รท 2 DV, AP -3; Tags:
            Natural, Disease. If you deal DV, then your target is
            exposed to the disease. Build disease rules and come back.
        -   Electricity: you can deliver powerful electric shocks. Your
            unarmed attacks (and natural weapons, should you have any)
            deal an additional 1D10 damage and gain the Electric tag.
        -   Fire: you can breath fire. You gain the following attack:
            Indicate-Only Attack, 1D10+DB DV, AP -, Blast. Tags:
            Natural, Fire.

-   Optional Background: Dragonshire Noble

    -   You hail from a noble bloodline in the Dragonshire. Though
        actual rule now rests in the hands of the House of Commons,
        having the right ancestors\* _is still _useful\*.
    -   10 ranks in Protocol, 10 ranks on one other Social skill, 10
        ranks in one Combat skill
    -   Either the Noble Class or the Officer Class. If you select the
        Officer Class, you must later purchase the Soldier class during
        character creation, to meet its prerequisites.

### Gnolls

-   Almost as social as humans and incredibly strong, Gnollish strength
    (and endurance) was the backbone of the early Commonwealth.
-   Gnolls are very common in small farming communities everywhere, and
    in the mid-sized manors throughout Heartland Province.
-   Gnolls make up more than half of the Commonwealth Military, where
    their strength is invaluable.
-   A small number of Gnollish tribal communities still exist.
-   Gnolls display less sex dimorphism than some other races do; because
    of this, Gnollish females have long served in military and
    leadership rolls.
-   Gnolls "cultural memory" still very much includes the legend of
    fleeing persecution from other savage Gnolls and settling beside
    humans; to this day, Gnolls are immensely proud of their roll in
    founding the Commonwealth, and the roll they continue to play in its
    prosperity and safety.
-   Gnolls put quite a lot of effort into getting along with members of
    other communities, and will go out of their way to make other races
    feel comfortable around them. Many Gnollish communities have two
    separate set of customs, one for "when other races are around," and
    one for when they're not. They are not secretive about this; they
    do this because, for example, they are evolved from carrion-eaters
    and most other races don't want to see Gnoll "cooking."
-   Gnolls are aware of how savage they look, and many put quite a lot
    of effort into developing elaborate, refined personal styles to
    counter this effect.
-   Gnolls are roughly humanoid, save their great size---and that they
    have the head and feat of a hyena, and are covered in dusky or ochre
    fur.
-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 50 Years
    -   Average Height: 2.2m
    -   Average Weight: 80kg

-   One of three Founding Races. Strong and tough, Gnolls are a majority
    of the military and are common on farming manors.
-   DUR 35, STR 35
-   \+5 INT, +5 SAV, +10 SOM
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light, Scent
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Gnoll
-   Language Group: GR
-   _Hide_: +1 Armor
-   _Scavenger_: Resistance to food-borne illness (+20 on related
    checks)
-   _Sturdy_: Gnolls can Negate one Wound

-   Optional Background: Military Family

    -   You hail from one of the many Gnollish military families.
    -   \+10 ranks in Fray
    -   \+10 ranks in two other Combat skills
    -   the Soldier class

-   Optional Background: Caravan Guard

    -   Continuing a way of life that stretches back more than 700
        years, you travel with Halfling trade-caravans, serving as a
        guard, a bouncer, a hand and a diplomat.
    -   \+10 ranks in Intimidate, Perception, Persuasion and Survival

### Human

-   Social, dextrous and intelligent, Humans where the first race to
    build cities, and the first to build great nations.
-   Even today, Humans are widely renowned for their manual dexterity,
    for their society-building social instincts and their
    problem-solving abilities.
-   One of the three founding races (besides Gnolls and Halflings),
    Humans are widely regarded as the "social problem-solvers" who
    helped bind together all the widely different communities that came
    together to form the early Commonwealth.
-   Humans are frequently academics, professionals, scholars, lawyers
    and politicians.
-   Humans are common in the small towns of Heartland and Dragonshire,
    and are common in cities everywhere. And, of course, are the
    principle race of the Kingdoms of Man.
-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 60 years
    -   Average Height: 1.7m
    -   Average Weight: 60kg

-   One of the three Founding Races. Intelligent, dextrous and social,
    humans are the engineers of the Commonwealth -- building everything
    from wagons to societies.
-   DUR 30, STR 30
-   \+5 COG, +5 COO, +10 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Human
-   Language Group: HHED
-   Social Animals:

    -   Humans reduce penalties to Social skills by 10.

        -   No, that's just boring, and it's kind of weird because it
            requires special-casing that a flat +10 to Social skill
            tests wouldn't have (although the latter would also be way
            too powerful on its own).

    -   After making a Social skill test, a Human may spend one Luck
        Point to re-roll it; they must take the second result, even if
        it's worse.

        -   I like one powerful, discrete ability more than nudging
            checks by 10, but is introducing re-rolls opening a can of
            worms?

    -   Humans gain the Social Animal trait.

        -   You know, I might not actually like this any better than the
            thing it's replacing.

### Kobold

-   Kobolds are a relatively new addition to the Commonwealth; most
    Kobold communities trace their origins to a mass exodus from the
    Kingdom of Man roughly 200 years ago.
-   Kobolds are sociable, creative, and very quick.
-   Kobold culture is very family-oriented, and very community-oriented
-   Extended families tend to live together in large homes, and several
    families will cluster together to form a block.
-   Kobolds communities tend to have small personal spaces and large
    public spaces; Kobolds tend to take enormous pride the quality of
    their public spaces, which will commonly be excellently maintained,
    and will feature impressive monuments or natural landscapes.
-   Kobolds have a short lifespan, but they also tend to have large
    families; because of this, they have grown explosively

    -   even though they were absorbed only recently, many of the
        largest Commonwealth city-states are underground Kobold
        metropolises.

-   They tend to live near Dwarves and Ash Elves, both of which are very
    long-lived. This can create some complex relationships: it is not
    uncommon for one Dwarf or Elf to closely befriend several
    generations of one Kobold family in succession, watching each
    generation come into adulthood, have children and pass away -- an
    arrangement that can be very bittersweet for the Dwarf or Ash Elf
    involved.
-   Kobold culture strongly encourages industry, so Kobold communities
    tend to be highly productive.
-   They look like tiny, bipedal dragons. Somewhat like Drakes, their
    scales can take on a range of colors, and often metallic hues;
    however, unlike Drakes, this rarely has any effect on the Kobold in
    question.

    -   Like Drakes and Dragons, and unlike other reptiles, Kobolds are
        warm-blooded.
    -   Kobolds aren't mammals; they don't have mammary glands, and they
        have internal genitalia. Because of this, Kobolds can have very
        different ideas about what constitutes "appropriate attire".

-   Vitals

    -   Old Age: 40 Years
    -   Average Height: 1m
    -   Average Weight: 25kg

-   Clever, quick, industrious and sociable, Kobolds make up the
    majority of the underground cities.
-   DUR 25, STR 20
-   \+5 INT, +10 REF, +5 SAV
-   Movement: Foot 5 / 15
-   Senses: Normal, Infrared
-   Tags: Natural, Humanoid, Dragon-Kin, Kobold
-   Language Group: DDK
-   _Scales_: Kobolds have +1 Armor
-   _Small_: Kobolds are small

-   Optional Trait: Chroma

    -   Though the blood of Dragons is thin in Kobolds, it does
        sometimes manifest itself.
    -   You gain resistance to one of the following: Chemical, Cold,
        Disease, Electricity or Fire.

-   Optional Trait: Dragon's Bite

    -   Though you don't possess a Dragon's breath, you have inherited
        (some of) their natural weapons, and they can be infused with a
        Dragon's fire---or some other elemental type.
    -   Your Dragon's Bite has a certain type. If you have the Chroma
        trait, then your type is the type you chose for Chroma; if you
        don't, your type is Fire.
    -   You gain the following attacks:

        -   Bite: Unarmed Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -. Tags: Natural,
            Your Type.
        -   Claws: Unarmed Attack, 1D10+DB DV, AP -2. Tags: Natural,
            _Your Type._

    -   You gain an additional effect, based on your _Type_:

        -   Chemical: Your claws and bite are toxic. Any creature you
            hit with either attack is _covered_, and thereafter takes 2
            DV a turn. Water can wash the corrosive off (requiring a
            source of water and a Standard Action).
        -   Cold: your natural attack gains -2 AP, and you can drain
            heat from anything you hold, bite into or breath on.
        -   Disease: your claws, bite and saliva carry the following
            disease: Build disease rules and come back.
        -   Electricity: your claws and bite deliver powerful shocks:
            anyone you strike or bite must make a DUR+WIL check or be
            stunned for 5 turns.
        -   Fire: your claws or bite are incredibly hot: your attack
            does +3 DB, and you can set flammable objects on fire.

### Shifters

-   Shifters live in communities in the tribal territories; they are
    rare elsewhere.
-   Most shifter communities exist in tribal territories. Though most
    Shifter communities signed the Commonwealth Charter long ago, in
    practice, they have established few entanglements with outside
    communities.
-   Though not exactly insular, because they do not generally produce
    goods for export, they are not generally able to import goods from
    other communities, and so they tend to have little contact with
    other races.
-   Notably, Shifter communities tend to be very conservative. They are
    wary of outsiders, and are happy to live their lives much as they
    always have, and be left alone.
-   Small numbers of Shifters filter out of the tribal communities,
    seeking the exotic experiences the rest of the Commonwealth has to
    offer.
-   While there are a few Shifter manors, and some cities host notable
    Shifter populations, Shifters who leave the tribal territories often
    find themselves alone in their community, the only shifter in the
    town or village where they settle. Because of this, shifters outside
    the tribal territories tend to adopt the culture of the community
    they settle in.

    -   Many shifters are not particularly social, so this often does
        not bother them as much as it might bother members of other
        species.

-   Shifters often find work that suits their personal inclinations,
    among the communities that they settle in; "their own inclination"
    is often affected by the tendencies of their hybrid form.
-   Appearance: In humanoid form, shifters somewhat resemble elves and
    humans. An individual shifter will often display traits appropriate
    to their hybrid form.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 90 Years
    -   Average Height: 1.8m
    -   Average Weight: 50kg

-   Half elf, half human, half wild. Lycanthropes that can shift between
    humanoid and hybrid forms.
-   DUR 30, STR 30
-   \+5 COO, +5 INT, +5 REF
-   Movement: Foot 4 / 12
-   Senses: Normal, Low-Light
-   Supernatural, Humanoid, Human, Elf, Shape-Shifter, Shifter
-   Language Group: HHED (humanoid form); GR (hybrid form)
-   _Hybrid_: You have two forms: Humanoid and Hybrid. The specific
    details of each form are fixed (that is, your Humanoid form (for
    example) looks the same every time you shift to it; you can't
    determine what your shape-shift forms look like each time you
    shift). You can shift between forms at will; changing forms is a
    Standard Action.

    -   In Humanoid form, you have a mixture of Human and (Wood) Elvish
        features.
    -   In Hybrid from, you are roughly humanoid, but with the features
        of an animal.
    -   When you create your character, choose two of the following
        benefits. You gain the chosen benefits while in Hybrid form.

        -   Claws: you have claws that do 2d10 DV, at -2 AP.
        -   Teeth: You have a predator's jaw, which allows you to bite
            foes. The bite does 1d10+2 DV at -2 AP. When you bite
            someone, if you score an Excellent Success, you may choose
            to _latch on_; this normally works like grappling the
            target.
        -   Hearing: You have superb hearing, gaining +20 on appropriate
            Perception checks.
        -   Movement: you gain one of the following movement modes (in
            addition to your other movement modes): Burrow 1 / 3, Climb
            3 / 9, Flight 3 / 9 / 36, Glide 4 / 12 / 48, Hop 4 / 12,
            Swim 3 / 9
        -   Scent: you have a superb sense of smell; you gain the Scent
            sense.
        -   Environment Adaptation: choose a hostile environment; you
            gain an adaptation that allows you to survive this
            environment. For example, you might choose to survive in
            extreme cold, and thus gain a blubber layer.
        -   Motion-Sensitivity: your vision becomes very sensitive to
            motion. You gain +10 to Perception tests made against moving
            targets.
        -   Sprinter: choose one movement mode; increase that mode's
            running speed by that mode's base speed. For example,
            Walking 4/12 could be increased to Walking 4/16.

-   _Fast-Healing_: you have Fast Healing 1

-   Optional Trait: Animal Form.

    -   If you purchase this trait, you gain an Animal form as well.
        Your animal form resembles a normal member of your Animal type.
        Your animal form can't be too large (as large as an elephant,
        larger than size Large) or too small (as small as a cricket,
        smaller than size Small).

## Uncommon races

### Clay Men

-   ancient, amorphous race. No internal organs or specialized tissues.
    Cannot make precise shapes. Have a texture and appearance somewhat
    like a giant mass of clay. (Can produce a wide variety of sounds,
    including speech, with surface vibrations.)
-   DUR 35, STR 20
-   \+5 SAV, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Burrow 3 / 9, Surface 3 / 9, Swim 4 / 12
-   Senses: Infra-Red, Mage Sight, Tremor Sense
-   Tags: Supernatural, Shape-Shifter, Amorphous, Clay Men
-   Language Groups: CM
-   _Amorphous_: Clay Men are amorphous, and can manipulate their shape
    at will; they can stretch, narrow, ball up, flatten out, and so on.
    They cannot produce fine features, or alter their texture or color
    (other than to grip, as in _Pseudopods_ below), and thus they cannot
    mimic specific people or objects. However, they can slip through
    small spaces, and they can be almost impossible to grapple or
    restrain effectively.
-   _No Vital Organs_: Clay Men do not have vital organs, and thus they
    are not vulnerable to attacks or powers that rely on targeting weak
    points or vital organs.

    -   They have Resistance to attacks with the Precision tag.

-   _No Face_: Clay Men have no particular "front" or facing, and they
    have no discrete sensory organs -- so they can perceive all around
    themselves, including directly above and below themselves.
-   _Pseudopods_: Clay Men can extend pseudopods. They can extend up to
    four pseudopods, each up to a meter long. They can manifest one
    fewer pseudopod to make on other pseudopod one meter longer (so they
    could, for example, extrude one four-meter pseudopod, or two
    two-meter pseudopods).
-   _No Bones_: Lacking a skeletal structure, Clay Men cannot take
    advantage of leverage; this severely reduces their ability to deploy
    their strength. Their damage bonus when using melee weapons is 0.
    This ability may have other consequences as well.
-   Envelop: Clay Men have a unique form of physical combat available to
    them: simply enveloping (and then digesting) an enemy. Enveloping
    works much like Grappling, except that a successfully enveloped
    enemy takes 1d10รท2 DV per turn while enveloped (this damage has the
    Chemical tag). Enveloped targets are normally held immobile, but, if
    they succeed on a STR+SOM check, they can deal damage to the Clay
    Man with any weapon they are holding (or any natural weapon).
-   _Fast Healing_: Clay Men have Fast Healing 1
-   _Powered_: Clay Men have internal supernatural process that help to
    keep them going. They need to breath (by exchanging oxygen through
    their surface), but they can extract oxygen from water as well as
    breathing air. They need to eat to grow, but they need little food
    when not growing or repairing damage. They do not need to sleep.
    They can be effected by disease, but are resistant to most diseases
    that affect humanoids (they have Resistance to diseases). They do
    not age.

-   Optional Trait: Color-Changing.

    -   You can change the color of your "skin". You can create shapes
        down to the scale of a few centimeters, which allows you to
        create large letters, or to camouflage yourself (providing you a
        \+20 to Stealth).

-   Optional Trait: Rigging.

    -   You can produce an internal support structure made of cartilage.
        You can produce and dissolve the "rigging" at will: creating it
        is a Task Action with a six hour duration, and dissolving it is
        Task Action with a three hour duration. The rigging allows you
        to take advantage of internal leverage, and thus negates the No
        Bones trait; it also increases your STR by 5. However, the
        cartilage is fragile, and it exposes you to bits of tiny broken
        cartilage tumbling through you when you are injured; it reduces
        your DUR by 5.

### Dwarves

-   A large nation of Dwarves exists, but, while affable enough, most of
    them prefer to deal with their own kind -- and their own kin at
    that. Still, a few Dwarf Holds, complete with their surrounding
    territories, signed the New Charter -- and were reorganized into
    Northland Province when the Compact came into effect.

### Gnomes

-   Gnomes live in burrows in the lower ranges of the World Spine
    Mountains.
-   Gnome burrows reside near the surface; they are "burried shallow,"
    with surface entrances.
-   Gnome communities tend to be small; a dozen families or fewer,
    spread across as many burrows.
-   Gnomish communities tend to be isolated; they are not eager to
    receive guests, not even other Gnomes.
-   The outsiders they deal most frequently with are Kobolds, from
    burrows dug deeper underground in the World Spine Mountains.
-   Gnome communities tend to be _idiosyncratic_, owing to their limited
    outside contact.
-   Gnomish culture can blend the hedonic and the materialistic in
    strange ways. Because their communities are small and isolated, they
    are used to suffering hardship and want; however, they are also
    highly pleasure-seeking in their own way, and tend to be highly
    libertine and indulgent in the pursuit of mortal pleasure (when they
    have the opportunity).
-   As a result, they may appear to be humble, simple and rustic---until
    evening descends, when the party drugs come out.

### Halflings

-   Halflings were one of the founding races of the Commonwealth.
-   Halflings have a somewhat unique dimorphic society; the young and
    hardy travel in Caravans, trading wares and selling their skills,
    while children, the infirm and the elderly live in fixed
    settlements.
-   Halfling communities tend to form close, symbiotic relationships
    with Gnollish villages and families. Halfling communities are
    frequently built near Gnollish towns and villages; they depend on
    the Gnolls for security and labor, and the Gnolls depend on the
    Halfling caravans to sell their produce.
-   In particular, Gnolls commonly travel with Halfling caravans,
    providing security---and services like smithing, for which Halflings
    are poorly suited.
-   Caravans of Halfling traders and Gnollish guards knitted together
    the early Commonwealth, and remain on of its most iconic
    elements---if distant kindgoms know nothing else about the
    Commonwealth, they know about the trade caravans, and might have
    been visited by one.
-   Halflings have not grown at the rate that the other races have
    grown, and other forms of trade---notably mediated by ships sailing
    along major rivers, and along the coasts---have eclipsed the
    Caravans in the ability to move goods. Because of this, the fortunes
    of Halflings have fallen somewhat.
-   Still, the Caravans remain numerous, and are a vital carrier of
    Commonwealth trade.

### Herder

-   Herders are tall, thin and _roughly_ humanoid---besides the layer of
    short fur, the large, deer-like eyes, the antlers and the hooves.
-   They are also _extremely_ fast, and more than a little skittish.
-   The Herder where a tribal society that existed in the far West of
    the Emerald Plane.
-   Though distant from the Shade Elves, they were still within their
    reach, because the Shade Elves where commonly mounted and could
    strike far to the North.
-   The Herders formed an alliance with several other nearby tribal
    cultures, including a tribal Gnollish culture, for defense against
    the Shade Elves.
-   They were first encountered by the Commonwealth in CY 255, and
    peaceful relations where established.

    -   Between 341 an 344, the Shade Elves heavily raided both
        Commonwealth and Herder settlements; the two allied, and
        successfully devastated the Shade Elf raiders.
    -   In CY 349, the Herders signed a treaty with the Commonwealth,
        becoming allies; when the Compact was ratified, the Herders
        formally became members of the Commonwealth.

-   Herders are very social creatures; the live in large settlements in
    the open, grassy plains and gentle hills of the far West of the
    Emerald Plane.

    -   Though they are a primitive tribal society, they cannot digest
        meat efficiently, and so they practice agriculture---using
        inlets cut from rivers to irrigate grain fields and orchards.
        Check that this makes some sense.
    -   They often hunt and trap, as much for the sake of pelt,
        tradition and trade as to feed themselves
    -   Their settlements are often situated near rivers, and they farm
        and fish.
    -   Many of their settlements are still walled, owing to the
        continued risk of Shade Elf raids, even to the present day---and
        despite the heavy presence in the region of Commonwealth guards.

-   They are a traditional and somewhat insular people, and show little
    interest in trade or exchange with the wider Commonwealth.
-   They make excellent archers, and are extremely quick over open
    terrain, which can make them frustrating opponents for Shade Elves,
    and valuable allies for other nearby tribes (and partners for tribal
    gnolls specifically).
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 45 years
    -   Average Height: 2.1m
    -   Average Weight: 75kg

-   Quick, dextrous, sociable and peaceful -- but also weak and frail,

### Orks

-   Centuries ago, 165 years before the first Commonwealth Charter, orks
    founded cities in the foothills to the West of the World-Spine
    Mountains.
-   They were a tribal society: extended Families allied into Clans, and
    several Clans cooperate to found a city.
-   They were a warlike honor-society

    -   Orcs are large and have poor reflexes; they made poor riders,
        and so they marched to war, with their baggage-train carried by
        oxen. They forced other nearby societies to pay tribute, and
        there-after warred among themselves.
    -   For conflicts within their society, they used a system of
        ritualized combat.
    -   The period before contact with the Commonwealth represents a
        golden age for the orcs, a period of wealth and power---and a
        time of misery for their neighbors.

-   Humans of the Old Empire avoided Orcish lands, using their
    tributaries as a buffer.
-   Centuries later, in CY 91, the Commonwealth began to spread west of
    the World-Spine, incorporating former Imperial human settlements and
    willing tribes alike.

    -   In CY 113, the Commonwealth allows a tributary civilization to
        join; they stop paying tribute, and the orcs sack them.
    -   This leads to a Commonwealth siege of the city that launched the
        attack.
    -   Other orcish cities marshal an army and attempt to break the
        siege; they are defeated.
    -   This leads to 20 years of warfare between the Commonwealth,
        which goes poorly for the Orcs. By CY 131, they are left with no
        tributaries, surrounded by Commonwealth settlements and
        Commonwealth-allied tribes.

-   There follows a time of misery. Orcs had inadequate local farming
    and industry; without tribute, their society falls into decline.

    -   It's riven by internal conflict, as individuals, families and
        clans battle over the wealth and power they have.
    -   The Orcish population undergoes a contraction, and their cities
        and roads suffer great damage.

-   A generation or Orcs grows up in misery, look out at the
    Commonwealth. Some go to explore it, and return.

    -   In CY 154, the orc Odna returns from exploring the Commonwealth,
        and begins to advocate for a radical course: joining the
        Commonwealth and subscribing to their laws.
    -   Through CY 155, he challenges his own clan head, and then a
        champion of the clans of his city; he wins both challenges, and
        his city (the city of Akala) joins the Commonwealth.
    -   Similar movements prevail in two other orcish cities.

-   Today, Orcs have been members of the Commonwealth for almost 700
    years.

    -   Orcish culture struggled to adapt itself to Commonwealth law and
        tradition: today, it is a blend of traditional orcish elements,
        and imports from the rest of the Commonwealth.
    -   Their views on the Commonwealth and their place within it are
        complex. Though they take pride in being members of an ascendant
        and prosperous people, they also remember how they came to be
        members in it---the most traditional among their numbers claim
        that they were conquered, and that they still bear the shame of
        it.
    -   Most have taken the view that great works and labors are also
        achievements worthy of honor and glory---although their most
        traditional still believe that victory in combat is the greatest
        honor.
    -   Though some orcs remain within their ancient borders and
        practice a (modified) version of their traditions, others travel
        beyond their borders, seeking honor and accomplishment (and to
        bring wealth home, since Orcish communities still do not have
        adequate farming).
    -   Unsurprisingly, many Orcs seek honor and recognition in the
        Commonwealth military. Orcs are quite strong, and so many seek
        work as laborers---orcish cities actually boast impressive
        architecture. Orcs can be quite clever, and some even seek honor
        and achievement in the Commonwealth's universities (orcish
        scholars are generally not known for being nurturing and
        understanding mentors).
    -   Notably, many Elvish communities exist near Orcish ones. Most
        orcs and elves have good relations, as they are both tribal
        cultures and have long lived near each other---for most, their
        time of conflict is centuries past and forgotten. Still, a few
        of the most traditional---in both communities---keep ancient
        grudges alive.

-   The Orcish people can claim 6 major cities: five are their
    traditional cities, and the sixth was established on the
    Commonwealth's border with the Shade Elves. Of the orcs five
    traditional cities, three are members of the Commonwealth, and the
    remaining two are not.

    -   When dealing with each other, orcs use their ancient customs,
        and orcs come and go between the Commonwealth and independent
        cities freely.
    -   As a historical note, the city of Tonilac changed hands once: it
        was claimed by honorable combat by independent orcs, before
        being reclaimed by the Commonwealth six years later.
    -   The city of Collac is the city the Orcs built on the Shade Elf
        border; it is heavily fortified, and the orcs there skirmish
        constantly with the Shade Elves, their allies, and their
        subjugate peoples.

-   Orcs are roughly humanoid. They are tall, lean and muscular. Their
    skin is typically either green, brown, or red; most clans will have
    one skin tone that is more common among them. Orcs also have
    prominent tusks.

-   Cultural Weapon: Orcish Sabre

    -   Orcs traditionally use a sword and shield when fighting. They
        commonly use a large back-sword---a sword with one edge, because
        they are easier to produce in large numbers. The tips are
        commonly sharpened to a point, so that they may be used for
        thrusting.
    -   Bladed Weapons: 2d10+4+DB, AP -2

        -   One-Handed

        consists of double-sided, sword-like blade, perhaps 45cm long,
        at the end of a pole 200cm long or more.
    -   The sword-end sometimes also sports guard-like blades at its
        base.

### Ratfolk

-   More than 500 years ago, there was a Ratfolk civilization in the
    Warren Isles, an island chain off the Southwest near the Haven
    Isles.
-   They were organized into warrens run by families, and practiced
    fishing and farming.
-   Shortly before the Haven Isles where settled, some stronger clans
    began to subjugate their neighbors, centralizing power.
-   Shortly after the Haven Isles where settled, Shade Elves begin
    raiding the Ratfolk, and large numbers of Ratfolk begin fleeing
    their original home. Some travel north to the Haven Isles, where
    they are eventually incorporated into the Commonwealth; others flee
    South and settle on Raptor's Plane, where they coexist with Raptors.
-   There are now 3 distinct Ratfolk cultures:

    -   they have a large population in the Commonwealth, first in the
        Haven Isles and now spreading throughout Heartland;
    -   they are one of the two founders of the Raptor's Alliance,
        formed with the raptors to repel Shaded Sea Peoples, including
        their "cousins";
    -   the Shaded Sea Peoples, a society consisting of Ratfolk and
        Shade Elf families.

-   Natural traders and merchants; in the Commonwealth, Ratfolk tend to
    get along well with Halflings and Humans.
-   As scavengers, they also get along well with Gnolls; Ratfolk are one
    of the few species that can eat the same food.
-   Ratfolk are one of the Commonwealth's subterranean cultures; they
    often dwell in underground burrows.
-   Though Ratfolk do maintain their own culture and tradition, they
    were heavily assimilated into the established Commonwealth culture
    that sheltered them.
-   They are comfortable in urban environments and often live beside
    other races and cultures. They are comfortable above-ground and
    underground, and often work as traders and artisans.
-   Uniquely Ratfolk settlements are often organized around warrens;
    similar to Dwarven holds, they are mixed above-ground and
    subterranean structures. They still maintain fishing and seafaring
    traditions.
-   They commonly speak Haven Isles Ratfolk (language group GR).
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 55 Years
    -   Average Height: 1.25m
    -   Average Weight: 34kg

    and Gnolls (they're one of few species that can eat Gnollish food
    and speak Gnollish languages). Taking very well to settled urban
    life, and growing very quickly.

        each Clan consists of several family, each of which will
        maintain a warren and holdings.

        commonly speak Warren Isles Ratfolk (language group GF)
        natively.

-   Optional Background: Raptor's Plane Ratfolk

    -   The descendants of Ratfolk who fled Southward from their
        cousins, settled on the Raptor's Plane and ultimately allied
        with the Raptors.
    -   They settled on the coasts and inland jungles closest to their
        cousins, and continue to suffer heavy raiding.
    -   Inland, they live in large, underground settlements, carved into
        the sides of rocky foothills.
    -   On the shores, where burrowing is impractical, they live in a
        walled cities of a few thousand.
    -   Still socially-inclined and natural traders, they have opened
        trade with the Commonwealth (and have been surprised to
        encounter their distant cousins in the Commonwealth's fleets).
    -   They still fish and trade along rivers and shores, although
        Shaded Sea piracy makes this dangerous.
    -   \+10 Ranks in Protocol, +10 Ranks in one Combat skill, +10 Ranks
        in one Trade Skill

        they gain 10 ranks in Raptor. They usually speak Jungle Ratfolk
        as a native language.

### Shamblers

-   Shamblers are spirits bound to plants.
-   They originated in the dense marshes of the Southern lowlands to the
    East of the World-Spine Mountains.
-   They were created when Father Cypress, a Great Spirit who admired
    mortals and wished to interact with them, created plants with
    internal processes that could support Spirits, and fashioned of
    himself Spirits who could dwell within them.
-   Owing to their ability to root, Shambler communities lack cleared
    fields and grazing-lands---they also tend to have an active night
    life.
-   Despite being the children of a Great Spirit associated with
    isolated, deep swamps, Shamblers can be surprisingly urbane; they
    are welcoming of outsiders, and host many artisans and traders.
-   Shamblers are inquisitive, and their ability to root makes them
    light travelers; they therefore spawn many adventurers, explorers
    and wanderers.

-   shape-shifting spirit beings. Charming and suave, but also very
    frail. They can shape shift freely. They tend to live in urban
    centers among other races. Some Tempters live openly among the large
    cities of the Commonwealth; more almost certainly live in secret.
-   DUR 20, STR 20
-   \+5 INT, +10 SAV, +5 WIL
-   Movement: Shape-Dependant (Flight 5 / 15 / 60, Foot 4 / 12 or Swim 4
    / 12)
-   Senses: Normal, Mage-Sight
-   Tags: Spirit, Shape-Shifter, Tempter
-   Language Group: Shape-Dependant (HHED / GR / DDK)
-   _Appearance of Flesh_: Tempters are Spirits, and thus they do not
    age, do not need to eat, drink or breath, and do not need to sleep.
    However, even though they are Spirits, they are physical beings (and
    thus, their bodies may be wounded, and they may be killed, using all
    the rules for normal creatures). More than that, it is required of
    them that their form always resemble that of a flesh-and-blood
    creature -- although the details of their form are otherwise up to
    them.
-   _Shape-Shifting_: Tempters can take the form of any medium-sized
    natural creature. They can control the details of their physical
    form as they wish, including being able to mimic specific
    individuals.

    -   They can change shape as a Standard Action.
    -   They have fine control over their appearance. They can mimic a
        specific individual; this requires a Disguise check at +20.
    -   Changing shape does not affect their statistics; however, as
        listed above, they receive appropriate movement modes and
        natural attacks.

-   Note: as Spirits, Tempters are immediately obvious to anyone with
    Mage-Sight.

-   Optional Negative Trait: Bind

    -   You have a _bind_, the details of which you should work out with
        your GM. The bind should pose a real danger to you. It must be
        known to at least one clerical organization in the area where
        you live -- although it does not need to be widely known. (This
        is a negative trait; it you select it, you _gain_ 10 CP, which
        you may then spend elsewhere.)

### Wood Elves

-   There are many Elvish communities scattered through the deep forests
    and rolling hills of the western inlands.

    -   Though many tribes have joined the Commonwealth as members, for
        the most part, they have been content to practice their
        traditional way of life in the deep forests to the West of the
        World-Spine Mountain.

-   Elves are a tribal society: they build small permanent settlements,
    where the young, old and infirm live, while able-bodied adults
    travel the nearby forests hunting, foraging and herding.

    -   There are many distinct and independent elvish cultures, as
        their population is distributed in many small pockets through a
        swath of the Emerald Plane more than 300 miles across.
    -   They share this vast territory with many other tribal
        communities, including tribes of humans, gnolls and other races.
    -   They interact far more often with the other peoples around them
        than they do with their distant kin, and so their culture often
        resembles that of their neighbors more than it does that of
        distant elves.

-   Some very traditional (and, necessarily, very small) Elvish
    societies do not even practice settled agriculture: their adults
    hunt and forage in the woodlands nearby.

    -   Others practice different types of agriculture, with adults
        herding in the nearby woodlands.
    -   Some elvish communities practice subsistence farming, relying on
        seasonal rises in the rivers to irrigate wheat and rice fields.
    -   Others have developed workable if simple irrigation schemes, and
        use them for larger-scale farming.
    -   Some have even imported sophisticated farming techniques (and
        crops) from the wider Commonwealth, and produce a food surplus
        for trade.

-   Hunting is frequently an important cultural practice in Elvish
    communities.
-   Those elves that do depart the tribal lands to settle among the
    wider Commonwealth frequently join Ash Elf communities---indeed,
    given their long lifespans, many young Ash Elves grow up knowing
    their "first generation" Wood Elven ancestors, and pure-blooded Wood
    (and Shade) elves are not an uncommon site in Ash Elven communities.

        Stealth.

## Neighboring races

### Goblins

### Raptors

-   These small creatures, as like a reptile as a bird, are one of the
    races originally inhabiting the Raptor's Plane.
-   They walk upright, are covered in dark-green scales, and feature
    vibrant feathers as plumage on their heads, arms, and on their short
    tails.
-   Though they are warm-blooded, they don't handle extremes of
    temperature very well, and are most comfortable in the humid jungles
    of Raptor's Plane.
-   They have powerful legs and nasty claws, and are natural climbers
    and leapers.
-   Hundreds of years ago, they were a society of tribal hunters: the
    young and old lived in settlements, while the healthy ranged and
    hunted in the thick jungles.
-   Contact with the Ratfolk brought them access to worked iron and
    bronze, and the two collaborated to adapt Ratfolk farming techniques
    to the deep jungle; these have helped revolutionize Raptor culture.
-   Though many of them are still hunters, they have expanded the scale
    of their agriculture significantly, and trade with Ratfolk burrows
    for finished weapons and tools.
-   Vitals:

    -   Old Age: 50 years
    -   Average Height: 1.65m
    -   Average Weight: 45kg

-   Language Group: DDK
-   Scales: Raptors are covered in small scales; these provide them +1
    Armor.
-   Claws: Raptors have vicious claws on their feat, designed to grapple
    prey when pounced on from above. The have the following natural
    weapon:

    -   Unarmed Attack, 1D10+2+DB DV, AP -2. Tags: Natural, Grab,
        Awkward Placement: Legs
    -   Special: Your talons are difficult to use, being on your feet;
        they require that you pounce on someone from above, leap on them
        and pin them, or use some other similar tactic to bring them to
        bear.
    -   Special: Your talons are very good at gripping those you attack,
        digging in through flesh and bone as you do so. When attacking
        with your talons, if you score an exceptional success, you
        automatically grab your opponent.

### Shade Elves

-   These dark-skinned cousins to Wood Elves hail from the rolling hills
    and grasslands of the extreme Southwestern edge of the Emerald
    Plane.
-   They have long been a raiding culture, terrorizing other cultures
    near them.
-   Hundreds of years ago, early Commonwealth settlers allied with
    Herders and built heavily fortified settlements; a disastrous
    large-scale raid against one of these fortifications cost them
    heavily, which left them vulnerable to the Leapers, who invaded from
    below.
-   To meet the Leaper's demands, they turned to raiding the Warren
    Isles Ratfolk, until, weakened, the Leapers also assaulted the
    Ratfolk. The Leapers eventually forced their two tributaries into
    cooperation, forming the Shaded Sea Peoples.
-   They have heavily raided and been largely expelled from both the
    Commonwealth and the Raptor's Plane Alliance. They are still
    opportunistically raid both, and still practice piracy, with the aid
    of Ratfolk sailors.
-   To meet the tributary demands of the Leapers, they have turned to
    brutally subjugating and exploiting the other tribal cultures within
    their reach.
-   Shade Elves typically live in settlements dug into the hills, with
    the bases of slopes ringed by walls. Their settlements are often
    walled and fortified, owing to the need to fend off both slave
    rebellions and other Shade Elf clans.
