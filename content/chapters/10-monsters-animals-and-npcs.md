### Chasseh Forrest Spirit

The spirits that dwell in the woods south of the human town of Chasseh
have the ability to take control of the wildlife that is native to their
forest; these spirits are mercurial, and not particularly friendly;
though they can be bargained with, they are typically somewhere between
unhelpful and dangerous.

A possessed animal uses the animal's stats, but gains the Aptitudes,
Skill Ranks and Powers from the spirit. You may assign Aptitude Bonuses
appropriate to the creature, +10 to one Aptitude and +5 to another.

If the animal is killed, the spirit simply departs from it, flee into
the forrests.

### Cougar

These big cats are flexible predators, able to persist from the snowy
north to the humid south. They are solitary and territorial. They
usually hunt by ambush. Though dangerous, they can be backed off of prey
by other large predators.

-   Rake: Like many cats, cougars will attempt to grip prey with their
    front paws and bite, and then disembowel it with their back legs. If
    a cougar hits with its bite or claws and scores an exceptional
    success, it grapples the target. If a cougar starts its turn
    grappling its prey, it can _disembowel_ as a standard action,
    dealing 2D10+6 (2D10+2+DB) damage.

### Kambi

These small, furred, yapping creatures have a rudimentary intelligence;
they tend to live in simple, hierarchal social groups, and can build
simple "languages" with as many as 100 sounds and concepts. Attempts to
integrate them into Commonwealth society have failed; they are usually
managed as pests, and occasionally kept as pets.

Background may need tweaking; I want this to be funny, not dark.

-   Movement: Walking 4/12
-   Senses: Normal, Scent
-   Tags: Humanoid, Kambi, Wild Companion
-   Mindlessly Brave: Kambis have almost no instinct for
    self-preservation. On the plus side, this means that it is almost
    impossible to frighten them; on the minus side, this means that
    Kambis can fail to avoid even obvious hazards, blithely walking into
    danger and destruction.

    -   Kambis automatically pass tests to resist fear.
    -   Kambis have the Oblivious trait. Work on this.

-   Trainable: Kambis have a basic ability to learn and to use tools.

    -   Kambis can have up to 30 ranks in skills, in addition to those
        listed here.
    -   "Wild" Kambi societies will typically be trained in combat
        skills.
    -   "Domesticated" Kambis can be trained in diverse skills. (10
        points in a language is recommended.)

-   Almost Social: Kambis can be influenced by either Handle Animal or
    Persuasion.
-   Skills:

    -   _Chase_ 50
    -   Cooking 40
    -   Fray 40
    -   Intimidate 30
    -   Perception 40
    -   Stealth 40
    -   One Melee skill at 50

-   Items:

    -   "wild" Kambis will have simple armor (1 Armor) and a simple
        weapon (a knife, "sword" or spear).

### Raccoon

These small, intelligent omnivores have dexterous hands and a highly
developed sense of touch; they can be very difficult to manage, as they
can open bottles, jars, doors and simple locks. Though they can live in
many environments, they prefer those that afford them trees to hide in,
and streams where they can forage for (and wash) food.

-   Acute Touch: Touch is a raccoon's dominant sense, and they can

### Raptor

At first glance, these large, heavily-feathered predators might appear
to be birds. Their large, clawed, three-fingered hands might appear to
be wings, and can allow the creature to glide for short distances; their
large, powerful legs allow them to sprint and pounce; each foot has a
large, sickle-shaped claw on one toe, allowing them to grip and restrain
prey; and their long, articulated tails provide stability while
sprinting, leaping and gliding.

Raptors are common on _the Southern continent,_ where there are many
different species present, fitting a variety of different sizes, diets
and behaviors; some are larger, and hunt mainly by pouncing and pinning
live pray, while others are smaller, can fly, and hunt small animals and
insects. The one presented here is a medium-sized creature known as a
_get Acier to give us a name_; they operate in small packs, and hunt
smaller prey by pursuit or ambush.
